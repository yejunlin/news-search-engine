business	why few targets are better than manythe economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world leading economy by but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe does become a global economic laggard they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia india and china as well as with the economic might of the united states that why there was a tone of urgency in the report out on wednesday by the former dutch prime minister wim kok mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets five years on from their inception his conclusion was simple too many of the targets will be seriously missed lisbon risks becoming a synonym for missed objectives and failed promises his report said the status quo is not an option at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built it said the report comes at a time when europe competitive position is waning the eu economic growth rate is projected to be this year and next while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe productivity lags behind that of the us but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years as mr kok report noted the ink had scarcely dried on the lisbon agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit the circumstances were conducive to creating the million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so called knowledge based economy the lisbon vision is a compelling one but in order to do it society has to change said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council a brussels based citizen action group what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change you find trade unions fighting change but also the employers associations even though they tell you they in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case they covered too much according to the wim report economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing the kok report said everybody is responsible and thus no one that why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they taking towards meeting the targets effectively naming shaming and faming rhetoric and delivery do necessarily go hand in hand mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report we do have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another on one point mr kok was very clear the european union should not try to emulate the us economy the european economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth in that sense the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth it very ambitious said john palmer political director at the european policy centre a brussels based think tank this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do it going to require quite new and innovative policies but some analysts believe that the kok report does come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality for example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce but it does say how companies should be convinced to do this it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission jose manuel barroso to adopt mr kok recommendations and press them on eu governments mr barroso has said that the eu competitiveness will be his top priority he expects his five year term in office to be judged on europe success in meeting the lisbon agenda

business	making your office work for youour mission to brighten up your working lives continues and this time we taking a long hard look at your offices over the next few months our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient more congenial or simply prettier this week we hearing from marianne petersen who is planning to convert a barn in sweden into a base for her freelance writing work click on the link under her photograph to read her story and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say and if you want to take part in the series go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch working from home presents a multitude of challenges understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done do you build on the ideas of others or are you a more introspective problem solver in order for a virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like minded people may assist it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water and weather tight and the structure is checked for stability it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn this would also allow for a well insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate ideally it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in a light colour the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn as for lighting consider a combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne barn the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible a wireless router access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient however important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in a weak signal strength you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area your local it supplier will be able to advise on this if you have already invested in robust firewall and anti virus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment to really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor or you could use one of the new tablet computers which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built in hand recognition software and finally you will save money and space by considering a multi function product for print scan copy and fax

business	the ticking budget facing the usthe budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial the washington based economic policy institute which tends to be critical of the president looks at possible fault lines us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply cannot hold together news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come under direct threat will be the federal government ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund as soon as the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in years by conservative estimates to more than half the nation total annual output this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business even now a growing share of us borrowing is from abroad the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china among other nations this does not bode well for us influence in the world the decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue the dollar is already sinking before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards that will be the shock interest sensitive industries will feel pain immediately sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget the public outcry will force congress to act whether it will act wisely is another matter how did this happenby definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending but this neutral description does adequately capture the current situation federal revenues are at levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades much higher in addition the united states has two significant military missions the bush administration chosen remedy is the least feasible one reducing domestic spending or eliminating waste fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem indeed if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left law enforcement space exploration environmental clean up economic development the small business administration housing veterans benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear it fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed the biggest spending growth areas are defence including homeland security and health care for the elderly and the poor to some extent increases in these areas are inevitable the us population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world but serious savings can only be found where the big money is savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill serve the nation elderly and indigent on the revenue side the lion share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since will have to be replaced some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes finally blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned there is no good reason to fixate on it anyway moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense the sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts second should be a dispassionate re evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to afghanistan iraq or terrorism third must be the start of a serious debate on large scale health care reform one thing is certain destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century

business	could yukos be a blessing in disguiseother things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business but in the looking glass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true a new report has argued the study from the centre for economic policy research does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms even targets of the tax police an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors say the paper reasoning is complex and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable in the west meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues on the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately the net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness after vladimir putin became president in he did not raise taxes but put a lot of effort too much critics argue into enforcement since then the russian stock market has more than trebled in value a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach the report highlights the case of sibneft a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year after mr putin came to power the company overall effective tax rate rose from to and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police but shareholders benefited hugely sibneft started to pay dividends in and almost in and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds according to the authors although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers does this analysis make sense in part certainly for all its faults corporate russia has become far more orderly and law abiding since companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges something unthinkable in the wilder days of the and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts in and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe but the authors model does not quite cover all the complexities for a start the model assumes that the various parties have clearly defined motivation companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia connections often greased by bribery blur the apparently antagonistic relationship companies can for example persuade officials to overlook non payment of taxes and the authors definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced the case against yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed as far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude since yukos founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested a year ago the russian market has dropped by an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance

between tasks this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is well what most important for me is to be japan number one mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone and when it comes to longevity japan as a country appears to be doing just that women can expect to live until men until four years longer than americans and europeans on the outskirts of kyoto year old yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends who are in their seventies i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved he remarks on average we can live longer whether it the diet or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined or just something in the genes japan elderly are remarkable but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead japan is the world least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us by japan population is expected to peak at million then shrink to under million by the middle of the century this means million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled in the year if the birth rate remains the same people over will make up over of the population explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo so how will japan finances stay on track after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending the public sector debt is already about of the country gross domestic product gdp the highest rate among industrialised countries the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from the cost of running japan welfare state will double to more than of gdp while current account balances will deteriorate by over but unfortunately japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically glen wood vice president of deutsche securities japan asks who going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker who is going to build the economy who are going to be the leaders who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward one option is further welfare reform another is immigration possibly from the philippines and indonesia but so far any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new york statue of liberty but as yet japan is not ready for an ellis island japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it an option that becoming more and more plausible and necessary insists mr wood in japan as in europe which also faces a workforce decline immigration is a very sensitive subject but for the japanese economy facing fewer consumers by means slumping domestic sales of cars hi tech kit and home appliances perhaps even another property crash of course the japanese could always have more children the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia but there would be no pay back until when today babies are taxpayers and the demographic crisis like in europe starts to unfold in in contrast to japan and of course the european union the us population is expected to increase by to million by the middle of the century although president bush must re devise social security to take account of a rise in america over the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market they want a shift towards financial services though doubts persist over the country ability let alone willingness to move away from manufacturing japan still has problems getting a viable banking system let alone shifting their auto business or their semi conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas says mr wood japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency come japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power there are fears that the world number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession but none of this is mr toshitsune concern anymore at he chuckles that he feels fine

entertainment	redford vision of sundancedespite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star struck crowds at sundance it a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city utah back in the now in its twenty first year sundance continues to grow some people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind it an opportunity to meet and make deals redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film makers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance which take place during the same week in park city are competing for sundance limelight but redford is not worried the more the merrier he says the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them once independent film had a place where the work could be seen suddenly the merchants came with them the celebrities came then the paparazzi and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone explains redford people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film he adds international film makers have always been celebrated here but is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect particularly how the us is perceived internationally he has never hidden the fact that he is a democrat but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration it the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration he says i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view that very unhealthy and very dangerous if we take that policy into the world there will be the same victims and the same consequences sundance is just one big screening there are discussion panels and q a sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like america culture wars and the iraq war while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic educated middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance with views from the same end of the political spectrum anti war and socially liberal but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience when you look at the films here what we are presenting is very much egalitarian and it about good films and good story telling be it african america asian women gay lesbian sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say it just a film by so and so

entertainment	franz man seeks government helpfranz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he said kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotland role in making century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they are self sufficient he said but so called commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however i do know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea kapranos and his glasgow four piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week brit awards including best group and best album their self titled debut album won last year mercury music prize and spawned three top singles he told the strong audience at the university reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say i like this because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual im riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm he concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i do really care about the brits he said it going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight i think the government should do more to help up and coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels rather than expecting the government i e the taxpayer to fork out why do some of the megastars put something back in some of britain wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government funds if they can fund football why not fund musicareas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash the government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that as a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it ! franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods ! i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque should be looking for government subsidies i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the masses there are already thousands of state funded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idol type funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about only if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales if they had a government grant to get started they have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they a musician the government should fund music it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies ! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for ! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government would have to fork out a great deal yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands artists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternitiesi agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is a great deal of money generated through pop music perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol style music that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you like though i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately funded organizations like save the music in the us

politics	howard unveils tory asylum planstory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees michael howard has said as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas some charities say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans by cutting the number of front line immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set in a speech in london on monday mr howard said it not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that firm but fair immigration controls were essential for good community relations withdrawing from the united nations convention on refugees which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need not numbers introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk a worry for national security stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australian style points system and those wanting to join families in the uk mr howard said nearly people were settling in the uk every year the size of a city like peterborough the plans would help achieve a substantial reduction in immigration he said although he could not predict a figure he said that only two out of asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current unfair and inhumane system we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum mr howard said by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans dangerous ill thought out and hugely irresponsible lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled she warned commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down and economic migration down about he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture mr howard called that suggestion disgraceful
politics	campaign cold calls questionedlabour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioner office says surveys are allowed but there is a grey area if personal data is kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run up to the general election but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law a spokesman for the information commissioner office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics not person by person if a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing he said the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future the spokesman said there was no yes or no answer and the area was pretty grey he added if someone complained then we would investigate that political parties are aware of the regulations at the last by elections we reminded them lib dem chairman matthew taylor has now written to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them

it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy silk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy silk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in fighting ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow ! interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name ! every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti europe feeling in this country kilroy silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroy silk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come ! well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party it all flash and no real policy herelet hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too twee label of veritas symbolises that

politics	woolf murder sentence rethinkplans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council led by lord woolf published its proposals for england and wales it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity but that has now been changed to one sixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation he said but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law abiding public the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said

politics	david blunkett in quotesdavid blunkett who has resigned as home secretary built his reputation as a plain speaking yorkshire man i fell in love with someone and they would go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer and then the news of the world picked up the story i tried for three years to make something work trust plain speaking and straight talking is something which matters so much to me as a politician and as a man that i have decided of my own volition to request an independent review of the allegations that i misused my position i do think anyone can say i have said one thing in public and done another in private it would be dangerous territory if i was practising what i preach which is to always accept responsibility always accept the consequences of your actions none of us believe countering terrorism is about party politics i accepted by necessity we have to have prevention under a new category which is to intervene before the act is committed rather than do so by due process after the act is committed when it too late he said in reference to new anti terrorism measures our work with the french government has been hugely successful said mr blunkett the number of illegal immigrants detected in dover has dropped dramatically strengthening our identity is one way or reinforcing people confidence and sense of citizenship and well being i foolishly thought as this was a celebrity edition it would be more relaxed than normal you wake up and you receive a phone call shipman topped himself you have just got to think for a minute is it too early to open a bottle
politics	no election tv debate says blairtony blair has said he will not take part in a tv debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election we answer this every election campaign and for the reasons i have given before the answer is no he said at his monthly news conference in october tory leader michael howard said mr blair would be running scared if he refused calls to go head to head in recent years the leader of the opposition has always called for a debate although it has never happened before the election plans for a debate between mr blair william hague and charles kennedy collapsed in a debate between mr blair and john major was also cancelled when a format could not be agreed televised debates have become the high point of the us presidential election campaigns
politics	what the election should really be abouta general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll we called for the state pension to be increased from to the pensioner credit guarantee level of that what we calling for many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system if we got one in five pensioners below the poverty line we got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty we drawn up a pensioners manifesto this will be sent to each of the candidates in the constituencies they will be asked which of the top five issues including the pension issue they would support once we got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well it our way of putting the politicians on notice we are trying to get across the fact that there are voters over in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters before most pensioners voted conservative in and they voted labour but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around they cannot take that vote for granted pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner full report into the issue he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment we have worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing we do have any large demonstrations planned but they ca be ruled out it is hard to say whether we will be successful we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq repealing the hunting bill we are challenging the use of the parliament act in a high court action we are hoping to hear in the new year whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time when the ban comes into force on february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid so there a lot of legal territory to go we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is rural affairs minister alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult it is not intimidatory on the whole it is groups of angry housewives of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face it exactly what the prime minister did not want he wanted the issue off the table until after the election people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting it is another sort of form of shooting for sport the principle is the same whether it a tiger or a pheasant we will widely publicise what happening in relation to trophy hunting we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it i think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure but it will mobilise public opinion everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade it become an issue in itself but what really missing from the debate is the consumer choice in that choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools we have seen so many pensions mis selling scandals and in the pensions industry there a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that we want choice on the consumer terms that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice firstly we have our website it features our campaigns and changes every day secondly through our members who communicate with us thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre election conference we will invite the opinion formers mps journalists and others the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians i think we will be successful it very much the language being used by the main political parties politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers we have been hearing about this proposed increase of per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that an increase of about if you running vehicles it obviously times that if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press regrettably it one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press whatever we do the public do like lorries they see us as a complaining minority but they do realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work when you see a lorry it already at work
politics	brown and blair face new rift claimsfor the umpteenth time tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster an issue many hoped and believed was above such things it dominated the prime minister monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour as he told journalists i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers there is a complete unity of purpose and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job and would continue doing it although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown long arranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was asked by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference well not really as it happens and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world although in the next breath he declared i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers before catching himself on and quickly adding in so far as i read them of course he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men as far as the timing of the prime minister press conference is concerned there are two options the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government has lost its once famed ability to strictly co ordinate announcements through the infamous downing street grid to avert just such allegations either way the effect was the same to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men firstly the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami hit countries it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt then as if to pour fuel on the flames both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott without mentioning the other all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had as a result started to set out his own platform the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission often seen as the prime minister turf has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other the prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself

sport	radcliffe tackles marathon taskspaula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics where she failed to finish the marathon and then the bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race the ability to run a gruelling miles relies largely upon an athlete belief that they can do it every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it are you strong enough to finish the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high profile and emotional circumstances sports psychologist hugh richards says the year old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence there is an old adage get straight back on the horse that threw you richards told bbc sport paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york win or lose if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong but if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled a has been and her profile will suffer and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions explains richards who has worked with past olympians she must not get caught up in someone else agenda radcliffe best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the year old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york she just thought well they ca think any worse of me now yelling told bbc sport she just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as impulsive but she is certain to have a tick list of personal goals her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets such as redemption you ca change history warned richards only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just days after the athens marathon it suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again said yelling herself a marathon runner but that is only for long term health and fitness when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly so physically it is possible for paula richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens he said and that just is going to be there in new york that been taken out of the equation radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage starting in new york how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not argues richards one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities and yelling says i think this will probably make paula i think it will drive her on and she come out of it a better athlete

sport	european medal chances improvewhat have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton win in the hurdles running sub eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sunday performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a head to head race will give sarah confidence in the men race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the men hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and hurdles and you ca ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we seen so far she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it was all good news in sheffield i thought both the races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he was at his best i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off day for him he there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there in the women race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two year drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that should be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them

sport	record fails to lift lacklustre meetyelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evening work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the world top three runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just has convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the front runners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish it would have been nice to see what mark lewis francis could have done in the final if only he had got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the false start game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is you meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i have seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france ronald pognon who has run seconds will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxton victory in the hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women national race in a new personal best of seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong squad going to the european championships scotland lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the but i do think the pace making was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the men but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly

sport	parry firm over gerrardlisten to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from gmt but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future he told bbc five live steven is above money he is the future of liverpool it does matter if it or we will not accept offers but we are also realistic enough to know we ca keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpool finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july from a similar role at the premier league there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parry revealed real madriddidask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said i sincerely hope he will be steven knows my views he knows rafa views we have re affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him we crave success as much as he does we know he ambitious and nobody can argue with that i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season he not alone in that there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a plus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer we did had an offer last summer parry explained we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we did want to sell him in reality it did go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there wo our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will that just does work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we decided to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in and he confessed arsenal deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye opener i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just has even been worth contemplating but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow that interesting my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to that not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse there no need and that is not the way we do business we had discussions with steve over the course of i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it did happen quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it we are still evaluating it steve interest was taken very much on its own merits his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door is closed on anything we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have a common interest in making liverpool successful that a dream we all share so as far as im concerned the door is not closed i would take if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really for gerrard i do care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i am hoping he does walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over parry statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he is then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non

liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history parry has to deliver a new seat stadium in stanley park by amid claims of costs spiralling above he is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore liverpool to their place at european football top table but it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with parry who has forged a reputation as one of football most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling premier league liverpool have not won the championship since a fact that causes deep discomfort inside anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of chelsea manchester united and arsenal throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard and you can see parry is a man with a lot on his plate but in the comfort of a conference room deep inside liverpool heartbeat the kop end parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead he only dodged one question when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool a polite smile deflected the inquiry but to his credit he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business by business he means becoming title challengers again and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to liverpool is parry mission parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez and his enthusiasm for the spaniard personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold benitez early work has given parry renewed optimism about the years ahead but it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations this will not come as news to parry a lifelong liverpool supporter but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting captain gerrard is central to liverpool plans and parry

environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish in terms of the search for new investment hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra came and went while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan morgan had a succession of bids rejected having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere morgan however has had no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his offer he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool morgan will certainly not be making another call so speculation continues about the new benefactor with trails leading to the middle east and america but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpool future but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up but there has been a vital new development in north london that has re shaped liverpool thinking liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights but the realism of arsenal stunning deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape parry labelled the deal an eye opener and admits liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just anfield but the maths of modern day football decree that multi millions for stadium and team could ease the pain i would take if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the

sport	time to get tough on friendliesfor an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the minutes at the end i would say it whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say you better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter finals against brazil often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and it very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole team worth the debate will rage on and im not sure there is a satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results it extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you england game against holland is a good example it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember sven goran eriksson side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed

constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future he told bbc five live steven is above money he is the future of liverpool it does matter if it or we will not accept offers but we are also realistic enough to know we ca keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpool finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july from a similar role at the premier league there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parry revealed real madriddidask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said i sincerely hope he will be steven knows my views he knows rafa views we have re affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him we crave success as much as he does we know he ambitious and nobody can argue with that i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season he not alone in that there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a plus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer we did had an offer last summer parry explained we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we did want to sell him in reality it did go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there wo our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will that just does work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we decided to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in and he confessed arsenal deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye opener i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just has even been worth contemplating but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow that interesting my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to that not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse there no need and that is not the way we do business we had discussions with steve over the course of i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it did happen quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it we are still evaluating it steve interest was taken very much on its own merits his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door is closed on anything we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have a common interest in making liverpool successful that a dream we all share so as far as im concerned the door is not closed i would take if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really for gerrard i do care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i am hoping he does walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over parry statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he is then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non

sport	mourinho plots impressive coursechelsea win at fulham confirming their position at the premiership summit proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all one thing is certain they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won at fulham which was a great result given that they had been showing good form as i said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players it is a priceless commodity no one can be anything other than highly impressed by mourinho he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk mourinho does simply talk a good game he won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions i also found him to be very realistic whenever i heard him he spent a lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital i also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good i just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with didier drogba injured he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league i felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelsea squad i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind if anything what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out winners mourinho had his say on that game complaining five four is a hockey score not a football score in a three against three training match if the score reaches i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly so to get a result like that in a game of against is disgraceful on a more serious note it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal defence confidence is a crucial factor in defending when you start conceding goals you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area you think oh no then find your worst fears confirmed arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board but the return of campbell is key he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit chelsea have no such problems at present which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season

tech	ink helps drive democracy in asiathe kyrgyz republic a small mountainous state of the former soviet republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population in an effort to live up to its reputation in the as an island of democracy the kyrgyz president askar akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid with a hastily pushed through referendum in reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with deputies the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections the german embassy the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated the ink is sprayed on a person left thumb it dries and is not visible under normal light however the presence of ultraviolet light of the kind used to verify money causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light at the entrance to each polling station one election official will scan voter fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter and every voter will have his her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station likewise any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics notably ukraine and georgia the use of ink has been controversial especially among groups perceived to be pro government widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems others such as the aggressively middle of the road coalition of non governmental organizations have lauded the move as an important step forward this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world in countries as varied as serbia south africa indonesia and turkey the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink but as the elections in afghanistan showed improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems the use of invisible ink is not without its own problems in most elections numerous rumors have spread about it in serbia for example both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink various soft drinks solvents and cleaning products are put forward however in reality the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off the ink stays on the finger for at least hours and for up to a week the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills the passage of the inking law is nevertheless a clear step forward towards free and fair elections the country widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for february david mikosz works for the ifes an international non profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies

tech	apple laptop is greatest gadgetthe apple powerbook has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc the laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs the magazine has compiled an all time top list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the zenith remote control at two gadgets needed moving parts and or electronics to warrant inclusion the magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a self contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded the oldest gadget in the top is the abacus which the magazine dates at a d and put in place other pre electronic gadgets in the top include the sextant from position the marine chronometer from position and the kodak brownie camera from position the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top which also includes the first flash mp player diamound multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv and mobile phone motorola startac the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number sony third entry in the top is the cdp cd player from who can forget the crystalline hiss free blast of madonna like a virgin emenating from their first cd player asked the magazine karl elsener knife the swiss army knife from is at number in the list gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone the nintendo gameboy and the pulsar quartz digital watch the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser toy tamagotchi and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler why worry about mobile phones soon they will be subsumed into the pda laptops etc what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries for it time a technological marvel ! sony net minidisc ! it paved the way for more mp player to explode onto the market i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it a laptop computer is not a gadget ! it a working tool ! the sinclair executive was the world first pocket calculator i think this should be there as well how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly has everyone forgot about the breville pie makeran interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early blessed the original noteboook pc the tandy the size of a paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible what an apple powerbook it out of date not much of a gadget surely it has to be something simple timeless the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off all top are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high tech obsession than anyhting else i say this as the swiss army knife only made no sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time the first home machine with a true multi takings os shame the marketing was so bad ! ! ! apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition i also put apple newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason i only wish that vulcan inc flipstart was just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvsthe swiss army knife by far the most useful gadget i got mine years ago still wearing and using it a lot ! it stood the test of time psion organiser series should be up there had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable case design was good batteries in the hinge a first i think great product innovation the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of err mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that the motorola startac should be number one why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices the psion series ! the first most practical way to carry all your info around i too would back the sinclair spectrum without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now i have put the mobile phone high up the list probably a nokia model sinclair spectrum it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that what i do for a living now i wish more modern notebooks even apple newest offerings were more like the pb particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses they invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use congratulations to apple a deserved win !
tech	google toolbar sparks concernsearch engine firm google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre selected commercial websites the autolink feature comes with google latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to amazon com if it finds a book isbn number on the site it also links to google map service if there is an address or to car firm carfax if there is a licence plate google said the feature available only in the us adds useful links but some users are concerned that google dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like amazon autolink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission if a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a book unique isbn number would link directly to amazon website it could mean online libraries that list isbn book numbers find they are directing users to amazon com whether they like it or not websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services dan gillmor founder of grassroots media which supports citizen based media said the tool was a bad idea and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth in a statement google said the feature was still only in beta ie trial stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users it said the user can choose never to click on the autolink button and web pages she views will never be modified in addition the user can choose to disable the autolink feature entirely at any time the new tool has been compared to the smart tags feature from microsoft by some users it was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any click through to a commercial site cory doctorow european outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group electronic fronter foundation said that google should not be penalised for its market dominance of course google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses but as an end user i would want to know can i choose to use this service how much is google being paid can i substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google mr doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using autolink or tricked into using the service

tech	uk pioneers digital film networkthe world first digital cinema network will be established in the uk over the next months the uk film council has awarded a contract worth to arts alliance digital cinema aadc who will set up the network of up to screens aadc will oversee the selection of cinemas across the uk which will use the digital equipment high definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly british and specialist films most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to screens in up to cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images the new network will double the world total of digital screens cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server each film is about gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte size file fiona deans associate director of aadc said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur the film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie people will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches the picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made there is no degradation in quality over time the key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of british films documentaries and foreign language films access to specialised film is currently restricted across the uk said pete buckingham head of distribution and exhibition at the uk film council although a genuine variety of films is available in central london and a few other metropolitan areas the choice for many outside these areas remains limited and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk digital prints costs less than a traditional print giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films said ms deans it can cost up to to make a copy of a print for specialist films in the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer the uk digital network will be the first to employ projectors which are capable of showing films at resolutions of pixels a separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in may the sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum they do need to be shown twice a day explained ms deans a cinema will often book a print in for two weeks even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema with digital prints every cinema will have its own copy

tech	intel unveils laser breakthroughintel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade we overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high volume manufacturing have been solved we trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy to make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semi conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses it a technical validation that it can work he said

tech	open source leaders slam patentsthe war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement mitchell kapor chairman of the mozilla foundation warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future linux is a freely available alternative to microsoft windows it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made of its patents freely available other companies are expected to follow suit there are between and registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they ca afford to take them to court said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future if totally pushed to the wall because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software of course they going to unleash the wmds mr kapor is reported as saying microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body intellect of which it is a member as far as intellect is concerned open source and patents have co existed for many years without problems said spokeswoman jill sutherland the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other she added

tech	solutions to net security fearsfake bank e mails or phishing and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say e business experts trust in online security is falling as a result almost of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people the survey of more than people reported that were not willing to hand over personal information online it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm rsa which carried out the poll an estimated million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e commerce and e banking are being taken seriously by banks in particular i do think the threat is overplayed barry beal global security manager for capgemini told the bbc news website he added the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves if we do that they will indemnify us he said many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual identity several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget last year a street survey found that more than of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate on average people have to remember four different passwords some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer in a separate survey by rsa said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems for many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard activcard is just one of the many companies like rsa security which has been trying to come up with just that rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one time passcode generation service users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for seconds many companies use a token based method already for employees to access networks securely already activcard method is more complex it is currently trailing its one time passcode generation technology with uk banks steve ash from activcard told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as seconds before it changes it combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions you take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given if you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction the clever bit happens back at the bank secure servers the code is validated by the bank systems matching the information they expect with the customer unique key each individual gets a key which is unique to them it is a bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said mr ash it means that in a typical security attack explains mr ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode by the time they go back to use the information the code has expired so they ca prove who they are according to mr ash in the next few years mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use pcs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards the gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants pdas and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around he said

tech	digital guru floats sub pcnicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mit media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries he said one laptop per child could be very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood he said the child could use the laptop like a text book he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linux based operating system we have to get the display down to below to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel the second trick is to get rid of the fat if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money in mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops we put in laptops three years ago only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious nokia make million cell phones a year so for us to claim we going to make million laptops is a big number but we not talking about doing it in three or five years we talking about months he plans to be distributing them by the end of and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order in china they spend per child per year on textbooks that for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that cheaper and the marketing overheads go away

tech	kenyan school turns to handheldsat the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up to date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e slates the e slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver the data is transmitted alongside audio signals the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e slates it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it it also stores this on its hard disc the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project it very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it also a one way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux based system the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions users can scroll through these sections independently of each other eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world largest university libraries all books in the public domain something like million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the e slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the e slates says the project ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting as they need it most

tech	gadget growth fuels eco concernstechnology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi tech products at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month several hi tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel apple and ibm among others to promote recycling the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over in but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the us environmental protection agency epa of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices one of the fastest growing markets in technology the consumer electronics association cea has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in will reach more than billion nearly billion ebay initiative pulls together major technology firms environment groups government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them the online auction house thinks that its already established community of loyal users could be influential we really became aware of the e waste issue and we saw that our million users can be a powerful force for good ebay david stern told the bbc news website we saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment teenagers get a new mobile every months adults every months and a million handsets are replaced in total each year yet only are actually recycled this year a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile according to a deloitte report schemes in the us like ripmobile could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages the initiative which was also launched at ces rewards to year olds for returning unused phones this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games said seth heine from ripmobile one group of students collected mobiles for recycling in just three months mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes learned behaviour europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust end of life programmes although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free there is more and more awareness on the consumer side but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free intel allen wilson told the bbc news website there is still low level awareness right now but it is on the rise the highest level of awareness is in europe a european union eu directive weee waste electronic and electrical equipment comes into effect in august it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances elements like chromium lead and cadmium common in consumer electronics goods will be prohibited in all products in the eu by but it is not just about recycling either the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too the biggest culprit according to the epa is the innocuous power adaptor nicknamed energy vampires they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones pdas personal digital assistants digital cameras camcorders and digital music players although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget on january new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct but at ces the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo meaning they are about more efficient the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers adaptors are being brought on board most are made in china about two billion are shipped global every year and about three billion are in use in the us alone the epa is already working with several companies which make more than of power supplies on the market we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hi tech devices but also bundle with it a hi tech efficient power supply the epa andrew fanara said initiatives like

tech	china to overtake us net usethe chinese net using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years says a report china net users number but this represents less than of the country billion people market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the million us users of the net by the report says that the country culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations said william makower chief executive of panlogic in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare this combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china only of chinese homes have telephones according to reports net usage tends to happen in the evening said mr makower they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf its fundamentally different usage to what we have here he said net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends said mr makower many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life for instance said mr makower credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt the most popular way to pay is cash on delivery he said and that quite a brake to the development of e commerce the arrival of foreign banks in china due in could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said mr makower but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar he said generally it more difficult for the government to be able to control it its real value is as an open window onto what happening elsewhere in the world he said government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet it a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it said mr makower

tech	rich pickings for hi tech thievesviruses trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash steal valuable data or take over home pcs viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to said pete simpson head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e mail message attachments it about outright criminality now said mr simpson explaining why this change has come about he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order former virus writer marek strihavka aka benny from the virus writing group recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers phishing gangs and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors not least said paul king principal security consultant at cisco because the defences against such attacks are so common in many ways the least likely way to do it is e mail because most of us have got anti virus and firewalls now he said few of the malicious programs written by hi tech thieves are cleverly written many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data if you think of criminals they do not do clever said mr king they just do what works as the tactics used by malicious programs change said mr king so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded as well as using different tactics criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent the main motivation now is money said gary stowell spokesman for st bernard software mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high with almost any phishing or spyware attack criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover so called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine

tech	smart search lets art fans browseif you do know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting artgarden developed by bt research unit is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection it chooses a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them so for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement century and water a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery said jemima rellie head of the tate digital programme for richard tateson who worked on the artgarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i did have a clue what i wanted he said the text based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead he thinks the dominance of text based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object you do arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they would have asked for he said the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that said ms rellie she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films

tech	web radio takes spanish rap globalspin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish language music but what you will not find is much spanish language hip hop hip hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish speaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad but now a us company is bringing rap and hip hop en espanol to computer users everywhere los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico hottest hip hop acts they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey but most mexican hip hop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanish speaking world rarely get a chance to hear the group tracks on the radio you ca really just go on the radio and listen to hip hop in spanish it just not accessible says manuel millan a native of san diego california it really hard for the spanish hip hop scene to get into mainstream radio you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world millan and two friends set out to change that they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible so millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio com the name says it all it is web based radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip hop tracks the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate all the user has to do is download a media player there are no djs it is just music streamed over the net for free suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan g are producing export quality rap the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip hop right now the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage but the production values are improving and artists such as argentina mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio com he considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hip hop scene millan says he really has had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but he definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish speaking world currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio com top as is cuban artist papo record every country got it own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says latinohiphopradio com has been up and running for a couple of months now the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world right now mexico leads the way accounting for about of listeners but web surfers in spain are logging in as well about of the web station traffic comes from there that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish language rap and hip hop millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip hop production that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio com top his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip hop leader in spain on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact it basically him bragging that he one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says and it pretty much true he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable it amazing latinohiphopradio com is hoping to expand in the coming year millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip hop and rap clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production

tech	the future in your pocketif you are a geek or gadget fan the next months look like they are going to be a lot of fun the relentless pace of development in the hi tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors particularly among mobile phone firms all suggests that is going to be a very good year to begin with will be the year that third generation mobile phones become inescapable the network launched in vodafone launched its consumer service in november orange followed in early december and t mobile and o are due to launch in the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up already the extra capacity in networks lets offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them and i write their obituary said niel ransom chief technology officer at alcatel instead operators are likely to push all other things that phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi megapixel devices go on sale but will not have everything its own way it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to megabits per second and works over distances of up to miles kent is likely to be the site of the uk first wimax network which is due to go live in and it could be the way that rural areas get high speed net access analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from and will be a clear winner bob larribeau principal analyst at telecom view said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of networks and the growing ubiquity of wi fi must not be forgotten either the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in too for a start bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next months the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip voip voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network anyone with a broadband connection which is now more than of the uk net using population can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared to be the area code for voip calls and is likely to see a lot more consumer focused voip call services starting up home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition if has been the year of the portable music player they looks like it will be the year of the portable media player motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had convergence could mean that single function devices start to dwindle in number instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want the only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with
tech	what high definition will do to dvdsfirst it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment high definition high definition gives incredible like pictures and surround sound the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out but when high definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high definition future is an exciting prospect he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high def world and i find it very exciting high definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition dvds in months time mr dean is confident though i think if they see real hd high definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen high definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too on the whole producing films for high definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about gigabits per second says mr dean our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second that a huge amount of compression that has to be applied about so if you have anything that allows more space you do have to compress so hard studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high capacity dvds currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean although the step of down converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day work says mr dean one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took human hours alone if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high definition dvd but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean high definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i everybody was very sun tanned but that was make up in the hd version of episode i all these make up lines showed up explains mr dean the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too there are scans of a corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just did see it what high definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband giving a dvd like experience from the set top box to the hard drive says mr dean but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves
tech	mobile games come of agethe bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing a brief round up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time even before nokia n gage game phone launched in late many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles there are shoot em ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie in increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available even the ones that use graphics the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth short range radio technology with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing too fast too furious digital bridges as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games because im rubbish at them no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit winning gives you cash for upgrades graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play fatal force macrospace a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth graphics are a bit cartoon like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring both background music and sounds effects work well the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while with the right power up you can go into a matrix style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps

tech	mobiles rack up years of usemobile phones in the uk are celebrating their anniversary this weekend britain first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on january by veteran comedian ernie wise in the years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline the first ever call over a portable phone was made in in new york but it took years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherine dock to vodafone head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on january cellnet now o launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about and had a battery life of little more than minutes despite that they were hugely popular in the mid he said they became a yuppy must have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only months to get the second million it very easy to forget that in when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until when one now t mobile was launched orange had its uk launch in both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular
tech	blogs take on the mainstreamweb logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow these online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye witness account of events most blogs may have only a small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics the most well known examples include iraqi salam pax accounts of the us led war former iranian vice president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic government and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign there are already websites pulling together these first hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs like wikinews com launched last november the blogging movement has been building up for many years andrew nachison director of the media center a us based think tank that studies media technology and society highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before he says and blogs were a key part of that transformation among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying we are sorry for george w bush victory and the responses from his supporters mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers tv and radio we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas he told the bbc news website but they followed the story they did lead it some parts of the so called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs others like the french newspaper le monde have applied a different strategy offering blogs as part of its content i do think the mission and role of journalism is threatened it is in transition as society itself is in transition says mr nachison however he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper the one to many road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse says mr nachison the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what acceptable for public consumption and what is that gone forever with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in a web already overloaded with information blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the so called blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels tools such as google blogger movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog us research think tank pew internet american life says a blog is created every seconds although less than of the total are updated at least once every two months but experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other said mr nachison and there going to be bad that comes with the good

tech	bush website blocked outside ussurfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re election site of president george w bush the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp the international exclusion zone around georgewbush com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites netcraft said that since the early hours of october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney failed by contrast netcraft four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis on october the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages videos and other content on its site reaches visitors mike prettejohn president of netcraft speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run up to the election on november he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign however simply blocking non us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites
tech	blogger grounded by her airlinea us airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog or online diary queen of the sky otherwise known as ellen simonetti evolved into an anonymous semi fictional account of life in the sky but after she posted pictures of herself in uniform delta airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay ms simonetti was told her suspension was a result of inappropriate images delta airlines declined to comment i was really shocked i had no warning ms simonetti told bbc news online i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog i thought if they had a problem someone would have said something before taking action the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites ms simonetti was suspended on september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mother death she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies the airline name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to ms simonetti the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother we often take pictures on flight or on layovers i just though why not include them on my blog for fun i never meant it as something to harm my company and do understand how they think it did harm them ms simonetti said she has also claimed that pictures of male delta airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web of the or so images on the site only one showed ms simonetti flight wings they did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with i am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up she said the images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended as far as ms simonetti knows there is no company anti blogging policy there is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear jeffrey matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers he said it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy you have to remember that as an employee you do have total free speech anymore he said mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog one of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they employees do cross the line he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line he said ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken if they had asked me just take down the blog i would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option she said this blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it if i had known it would cost me my job i would not have done that

tech	home phones face unclear futurethe fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take according to the study more than million people in the uk germany us and south korea now only use a mobile it showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile the nokia sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter between mobiles and to friends in the uk of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile however when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared in the us and germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds in all the countries where interviews were carried out older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile women aged or above almost never use a mobile phone the research found the move to mobile was most pronounced in south korea where of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile said they would not get a landline if they moved house many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the cosiness of making a call there nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap reliable and providing good call quality the survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years polling firm mori interviewed more than people in the uk us germany and south korea for the survey
tech	podcasts mark rise of diy radioan apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to songs which is a lot of space to fill but more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers it is called podcasting and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj video jockey adam curry podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast a podcast is basically an internet based radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home they need only a microphone a pc and some editing software they then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them all for free using technology based on xml computer code and rss really simple syndication listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software which mr curry has pioneered the latest mp files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically mr curry records hosts edits and produce a daily minute podcast called the daily source code he wants to make podcasting the next big thing and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry i was always into technologies and wires he explains my parents gave me the radio shack project kit which allows you to build an am transmitter and subsequently an fm transmitter i had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio mr curry is american but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the dutch capital he tried university in the us and ended up back in holland where he hosted a music video show he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top video countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet at a certain point in i was driving in on a friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking this is so stupid you know im going do the top countdown take the cheque go home and sit on the internet until three in the morning so after i finished the show i quit i said on air it been great i been here for seven years at that point there something on the internet i got to go find it and i see you later but mr curry technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high speed internet connections were becoming more widely available the mp format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before most importantly mr curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing listen to of the radio that you hear today it radio voices and it fake it just fake he wanted to make it easier for people to find real voices on the internet he wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like ipods mr curry is not a computer programmer so he asked others to create one for him no one did so he tried to write one himself he finished it a few months ago and says it totally sucked he put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it the result is a work in progress called ipodder doug kaye a california based podcaster praises the former mtv vj for what he has done adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the mp player he explains people can wake up in the morning pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise and discover that there all this new content automatically put onto their players it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia finland brazil even malaysia one couple broadcasts theirs the dawn and drew show from wisconsin in the us sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed topics range from the comfort of their bed to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners already websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know how to simply listen if i were to tell my mom or my mother in law to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator they would think i was speaking a foreign language mr mcintyre says along with technical challenges there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite albeit copyrighted music some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the anti radio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is playboy for his part adam curry pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which he says is a badge i wear with great honour to be the johnny carson or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful and you know what you do need a hell of a lot of talent you just have to be nice have your ears open and let people shine and that good for me clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co

tech	concerns over windows atmscash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses a security firm has warned the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small for many years the venerable ibm operating system known as os has been the staple software used to power many of the cash machines in operation around the world but ibm will end support for os in which is forcing banks to look for alternatives there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways todd thiemann spokesman for anti virus firm trend micro said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that of new cash machines being installed were windows based already he said there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them in january the slammer worm knocked out cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce in august of the same year cash machines of two un named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm incidents like this happen said mr thiemann because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system he said banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network mr thiemann told bbc news online but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year currently he said a cash machine has a lifetime of up to years which means that only about of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year windows cash machines have been around for several years he said most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os he said but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment it pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms he said the many different security systems built in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously he said banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all he added a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services apacs which represents the uk payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal there no concern that there going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks he said risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightly knit community than in the us where viruses have struck
tech	attack prompts bush site blockthe official re election site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it but keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses the policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush com website scott stanzel a spokesman for the bush cheney campaign said the measure was taken for security reasons he declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy the barring of non us visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place in early october a so called denial of service attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of pcs the attack made the site unusable for about five hours about the same time the web team of the bush cheney campaign started using the services of a company called akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic akamai uses a web based tool called edgescape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis readers of the boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the george w bush domain name ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site the site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site the international exclusion zone around georgewbush com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites netcraft said that since the early hours of october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney have failed by contrast netcraft four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems data gathered by netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack mike prettejohn netcraft president speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run up to the election on november he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign however simply blocking non us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too most american soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the us military own portion of the net akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites

tech	the force is strong in battlefrontthe warm reception that has greeted star wars battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its back to basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of all out gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves the sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first person perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player personal propensity for good or evil there is ample chance to be a wookie shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired up luke skywalker in each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet it really is no more complicated than that locations include the frozen wastes of hoth the ice planet from the empire strikes back complete with massive mechanical at ats on the march there are also the dusty sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis as well as the forest moon of endor where return of the jedi much maligned ewoks lived the feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic it is worth noting though that on the playstation the game graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version the pivotal element behind battlefront success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large scale war the number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over speaking of noise battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy audio motifs the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars it would not stand up for long the gameplay is reliable bog standard stuff short on originality there are also odd annoyances like the game insistence on re spawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be that said it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike however non user friendly they prove whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game the above average ai of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated battlefront novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty one trick pony of a game but for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas stable

tech	gta sequel is criminally goodthe grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition the certificate gta san andreas for the playstation could have got away with merely revisiting a best selling formula with a more of the same approach instead it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps carefree over all the driv and true crime shaped opposition even in the year that will see sequels to halo and half life it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic the basic gameplay remains familiar you control a character on this occasion a youth named cj who sets out on a series of self contained missions within a massive environment cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push bike to a city bus to a plane all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family to make things worse he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas comprising three major cities los santos which is a thinly disguised los angeles san fierro aka san francisco and las venturas a carbon copy of las vegas san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing its ability to capture the ambience of the real world versions of these cities is something to behold assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city the streets and vast swathes of countryside are by turns gloriously menacing grungy and preppy flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail the game overall look particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets is stupendous the outstanding bread and butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on cars handle more convincingly than ever a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds and there more traffic to navigate than before park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway and within seconds there will be a huge pile up pedestrians are also out in force and are a loquacious bunch cj can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad they will pass comments on his appearance and credibility aspects that the player now has control over clothes tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool the character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up but will swell up as a result of over eating and at last this is a gta hero who can swim at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young san andreas violence or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence are sure to inflame the pro censorship brigade developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality and in some respects ramp it up from past outings when hijacking a car for example cj will gratuitously shove the driver head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle indeed the tone is darker than the jokey vice city the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy setting of the last game this title incidentally is set in but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists the wit is still present just more restrained than in previous outings a further reason for this is that the incredible range of in vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options where gta games trademark humour is anchored the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off the chart the game rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed it is a testament to san andreas magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws but plus points are so numerous that the niggles do detract the on screen map for instance is needlessly fiddly an unwelcome change from past editions there is also a very jarring slowdown at action packed moments and the game suffers from the age old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings san andreas is among the few unmissable games of

tech	when invention turns to innovationit is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people lives substantially but says nick donofrio senior vice president of technology and manufacturing at ibm it was not the thing itself that actually improved people lives it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst having mobility and access when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the century we have to think more like this but faster mr donofrio told the bbc news website after giving the royal academy of engineering hinton lecture the invention discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered but by themselves they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did these are not altogether new ideas and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea method or device will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology argues mr donofrio industry week technology leader of the year the hype and over promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make a difference and life gets better as a result in the dotcom era there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes somebody had a new thing that would awe you you were quite sure that it did anything you were quite sure if you needed it you were quite sure if it had value for it but it was cool but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives he says will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be in your face it will creep in pervasively nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways through new superconducting materials to coatings power and memory storage i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure says mr donofrio pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules and where jewellery clothes and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires screens and keyboards the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there like air people will not have to do anything to stay connected people will know their lives are just better says mr donofrio trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances ultimately there will be says mr donofrio no value in being computer illiterate to some it sounds like a technological world gone mad to mr donofrio it is a vision innovation that will happen behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep computing says mr donofrio deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data and integral to this concept is supercomputing it has value according to ibm because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search results finding cures for diseases or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts commands and requirements of a diverse world as computing and technologies become part of the environment part of furniture walls and clothing physical space becomes a more important consideration this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience i am confident that the set science engineering and technology industry is going to be short on skills he says if i am right about what innovation is you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative women tend to have those traits a lot better than men eventually women could win out in both life and physical sciences he says in the uk a dti funded resource centre for women has set a target to have representation on set industry boards ibm according to mr donofrio has our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio we believe in the whole issue of global diversity he says our customers are diverse our clients are diverse they expect us to look like them as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them

tech	text messages aid disaster recoverytext messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television the blogging world though might know him better by his online name morquendi he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast cell phone signals were weak land lines were unreliable so mr senanayake started sending out text messages the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on the ground assessment of who needs what and where blogging friends in india took mr senanayake text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent and that when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call he says in every rural community there at least one person who has access to a mobile phone or has a mobile phone and can receive messages half a world away in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago taran rampersad read morquendi messages mr rampersad who used to work in the military knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help mr rampersad said imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets and had a central place to send a text message to that effect he can message the server so the server can send out an e mail message and human or machine moderators can e mail aid agencies and get it out in the field he added or send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region and they might have an excess of it and be able to shift supplies to the right places mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september last week he sent out e mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia in only hours he found dan lane a text message guru living in britain the pair along with a group of dedicated techies are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache the idea is to use open source software software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint and a far flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people says paul saffo a director at the california based institute for the future you may be halfway around the world from someone but in cyberspace you just one click or one e mail away he said that put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they not right on top of the tragedy it is still very early days for the project though in an e mail dan lane calls it an early proof of concept right now the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web page or distribute it to an e mail list in the near future the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages but there still another challenge you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use it amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to and say look this is what we trying to do and everything like that says mr rampersad so the big problem right now is the same problem we trying to solve human communication he is optimistic however he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments too will sit up and take notice and he stands by his motto courtesy of michelangelo criticise by creating clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production
tech	putting a face to big brotherliterally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi tech gadgets imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour and perhaps even alert you to new e mails basic versions of these so called avatars already exist together with speech and voice recognition systems they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future some of these ideas have been showcased at the london science museum as part of its future face exhibition one such avatar is jeremiah it is a virtual man which you can download for free and install in your computer his creator richard bowden lecturer at the centre for vision speech and signal processing at the university of surrey refers to jeremiah as him rather than it jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity he is very childlike he likes visual stimulus he told the bbc news website when he sees children running and laughing and waving at him he smiles at them if you ignore him he gets angry if you leave he gets sad and you can also even surprise him jeremiah is not actually intelligent it works on vision reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system it is not able to talk or to hear you at least not yet the surrey team is already working on jeremiah next version that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature finn the fish i am interested in the interaction providing the ability of a system to watch what going on and make decisions based on that explained dr bowden the research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi tech gadgets experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices such as a virtual human could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos if you get up at three oclock in the morning and you go downstairs there are probably two things you are going to do either going to the bathroom or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea said dr bowden now if the system can watch your behaviour over time it can learn this so it would predict what you are going to do turn on the lights for you or before you even get to the kettle it could have switched it on you might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left this might sound like a scary vision of an orwellian future but it might all depend on the face that is watching you when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them said dr bowden but when jeremiah camera went in nobody minded because although it still watching them they could see what it was watching
tech	football manager scores big timefor the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager cm indeed it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs however last year was the final time that developers sports interactive si and publishers eidos would work together they decided to go their separate ways and each kept a piece of the franchise si kept the game code and database and eidos retained rights to the cm brand and the look and feel of the game so at the beginning of this year fans faced a new situation eidos announced the next cm game with a new team to develop it from scratch whilst si developed the existing code further to be released with new publishers sega under the name football manager so what does this mean well football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series and it has been released earlier than expected at this point cm looks like it will ship early next year but given that football manager is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves how does this new version shape upa game like fm could blind you with statistics it has an obscene number of playable leagues an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans but that does not do justice to the game really what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from for instance england and scotland that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south of course you might be looking for european glory or to get hold of abramovich millions in which case you can take control at chelsea or even barcelona real madrid ac milan the list goes on a very long way once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you sometimes it is promotion or a place in europe sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle it might even be a case of champions or else obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose so choose wisely then it is time to look at your squad work out your tactics seeing how much cash if any you have got to splash having a look at the transfer market sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it then bring on the matches which are once more available in the ever improving top down view with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface not much else seems to have changed however there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well things like the manager mind games which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses the match engine is also much improved and it is more of a joy than ever to watch in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked and it leads to an ever more immersive experience with a game that is so complex and so open ended there are of course a few glitches but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches though there have been improvements in this area and a sport like football which is so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be modelled quite to everybody satisfaction but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay and if there are problems further down the line sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible in all there are many more tweaks and improvements if you were a fan of the previous cm games then fm might make you forget there was anything else before it if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership spurs into europe or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree fm could be the best purchase you ever made just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas football manager out now for the pc and the mac
tech	musicians upbeat about the netmusicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music a survey has found the study by us researchers pew internet suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file sharing while most considered file sharing as illegal many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders even successful artists do think the lawsuits will benefit musicians said report author mary madden for part of the study pew internet conducted an online survey of musicians songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april they ranged from full time successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music we looked at more of the independent musicians rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry ms madden told the bbc news website we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration with nine out of going online to promote advertise and post their music on the web more than offered free samples online while two thirds sold their music via the net independent musicians in particular saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically said ms madden they are using the internet to gain inspiration sell it online tracking royalties learning about copyright perhaps surprisingly opinions about online file sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry through the recording industry association of america riaa it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us it found that most artists saw file sharing as both good and bad though most agreed that it should be illegal free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing said one musician quoted by the report it hard to keep making records if they do pay for themselves through sales however said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters many suggested that rather than fighting file sharing the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy said ms madden

tech	no half measures with half life half life possibly live up to the hype after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it safe to say that this is the most highly anticipated computer game of all time fortunately it does merely live up to its promise but exceeds it no one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped all the money or indeed time is on the screen the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original half life having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster infested research facility he back in another foreboding troublespot the enigmatic city it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city but as soon as your train pulls in to the station it clear that all is not well here sinister police patrol the unkempt streets and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task it is not immediately explained what your objectives are nor precisely why everything is so ravaged finding out step by step is all part of the experience although you never fully get to understand what it was all about that does not really matter hl does not waste energy blinding you with plot underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective and immerses the player in the most vivid convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen there are no cut scenes to interrupt the flow exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top notch theme park thrill ride wandering through half life world truly does feel like being part of a movie considering its sophistication the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc components this is it on our test machine an alienware system with an athlon processor and ati radeon x video card everything ran at full quality without trouble and the visual experience was simply jaw dropping it is not simply that the surfaces textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them the haunting grim landscapes become strangely beautiful luckily you get time to pause mid task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings so impressive are the physics that you find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move there are puzzles to be solved along the way pitched at about the right difficulty but most progress is achieved by force freeman is quickly reunited with the original game famous crowbar and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with and in realistic fashion you will be wowed by the attention to detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls chase a pigeon out of your way or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed at times half life feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to and in a curious way its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome running around on foot is great enough but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles in gameplay terms hl somehow gets almost everything perfect and without resorting to the zombies leaping out of shadows approach of doom iii it all incredibly unsettling the vacant environment is distinctly eerie and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside the game does have a couple of problems firstly the carefully scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue which makes for exciting moments but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you completed it if you like things open ended and free ranging far cry will be a lot more pleasing but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run installing it proved a life draining siege that would test a saint patience developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy the box does warn you of this anti piracy measure but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed the temperamental valve servers and the time of day but it can take hours it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances but luckily half life is up to the challenge it is surely the best thing in its genre and possibly many will

tech	games win for blu ray dvd formatthe next generation dvd format blu ray is winning more supporters than its rival according to its backers blu ray backed by firms including sony is competing against toshiba and nec backed hd dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games the blu ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format the next generation of dvds will hold high definition video and sound this offers incredible like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of as we move from standard definition video images to high definition images we have a much greater need for storage richard doherty from panasonic hollywood laboratories one of the pioneers of blu ray told the bbc news website so by utilising blue laser based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today dvd a blu ray disc will be able to store of high quality data while toshiba hd dvd will hold mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high definition needs including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders both toshiba and blu ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the can be resolved over the next year when next generation dvd players start to come out when players do come out they will be able to play standard dvds too which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu ray in the battle for supremacy gaming is a billion industry worldwide so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical disc technologies said michael heilmann chief technology officer for vivendi universal blu ray offers the capacity performance and high speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming ea a leading games developer and publisher added that the delivery of high definition games of the future was vital and blu ray had the capacity functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations mr doherty said gamers were ravenous for high quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles gamers especially those working on pcs are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures deeper levels for delivering higher resolution playback he added the focus for games moving forward on increased immersion gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated models and textures and increasing the resolution increasing the frame rate all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost as games move to more photo real capability the current technology is limiting they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments said mr doherty currently graphics intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation high definition dvds will cut down on that need likewise consoles rely on single discs so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better high resolution games blu ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios such as mgm studios disney and buena vista as well as top technology firms like dell lg samsung and phillips amongst others while toshiba hd dvd technology has won backing from paramount universal and warner bros the real world benefits of hd dvd are apparent and obvious said jim cardwell president of warner home video mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd dvd both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox but discussions are still on going next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world and runs from to january
tech	file swappers ready new networklegal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down one site behind the success of the bittorrent file swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised that file sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to now the man behind suprnova org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new file swapping network dubbed exeem in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file sharing systems like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone there will be no centrally maintained list this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users an early public version of the software should be available before february sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development there were no plans for a linux or mac version he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program despite suprnova administrator sloncek involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer to peer networks said exeem was the next evolution in file sharing systems but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared exeem cannot prevent pollution he said the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that full of crap like kazaa he said there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said mr pouwelse said that future versions of file sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic it hard to compete with free he said no one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file sharing development
tech	online games play with politicsafter bubbling under for some time online games broke through onto the political arena in the us presidential election provided a showcase for many aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of the iowa game commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean more than followed suit including frontrunner elections president forever and the political machine which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign including having to cope with the media others helped raise the stakes during the bush kerry contest by highlighting a candidate virtues or his vices the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games a handful of multi discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers when i started researching political games at the university about five years ago i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen said gonzalo frasca computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved added the uruguayan born researcher who has so far created games for two political campaigns many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming com the aim is to comment on international news events via games the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation mr frasca told the bbc news website this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay cambiemos an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country problems could be solved by working together it up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games ultimately dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes fears and beliefs children learn a lot about the world through play there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns this is hardly surprising compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web only a few years ago most politicians did not have a webpage while now it is almost a must have dr frasca said political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them it will not replace other forms of political propaganda but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns

tech	who do you think you arethe real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net argues analyst bill thompson it is what happens when it arrives at the other end the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society our identities armed with the personal details that a bank holds plus a fake letter or two it is apparently easy to get a loan open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else name and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish but however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system in fact i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time has anyone checked bob cratchit family links to the criminal underworld i wonder and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted health authorities government agencies and of course the big e commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files companies like securewave for example can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual personal memory card these solutions are not perfect but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system however the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e commerce and online trading the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the back office it has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked in fact i do not know of a single case where an e mail containing payment details has led to card fraud there are simply too many e mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud cd universe powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job the issue is the same how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused any organisation that processes personal data is of course bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it unauthorised disclosure is not allowed but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice this is not something we can just leave it to the market the consequences of having one identity stolen are too serious and markets respond too slowly after all i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problems i doubt many others have closed their accounts especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft i have never felt comfortable with the us practice of suing everything that moves partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients so i know which i prefer bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

tech	a decade of good website designthe web looks very different today than it did years ago back in yahoo had only just launched most websites were text based and amazon google and ebay had yet to appear but says usability guru dr jakob nielsen some things have stayed constant in that decade namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today roughly of the things we found years ago are still an issue today he said some have gone away because users have changed and have changed because technology has changed some design crimes such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared said dr nielsen but there great stability on usability concerns he told the bbc news website dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site total design were as important as ever it necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such he said they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off he said but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google amazon ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful said dr nielsen adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet he said they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user none of them have a fancy or glamorous look he added declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied in the future dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online they are becoming like the operating system to the internet he said but he said the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better currently he said search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that on average they use terms in only words were used i think it amazing that we have seen a doubling in a year period of those search terms said dr nielsen you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme go digital

tech	learning to love broadbandwe are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work i can sit in a caf or a library with or without a wi fi connection and research and write articles if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne a children writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial up connection on her daughter laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial up she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively but the impact spread into her personal life too she did not take her children to the cinema during half term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website and she did not know where to go fossil hunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found a book on fossils but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things she may be unusual but i do not think anne is alone according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april and numbers are climbing fast there will certainly be five million by the end of the year dial up users are switching to broadband my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason it is part of the process of adaptation and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world in south korea japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient it may not be the brave new world of streaming full screen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now and it is certainly better than slow access or no access just ask anne bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
tech	nintendo ds aims to touch gamersthe mobile gaming industry is set to explode in with a number of high profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks far from looking like a mould breaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a handheld prototype the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm pre eminence in an increasingly competitive mobile gaming market nintendo first launched its gameboy console in and has dominated the market ever since but its lead can no longer be taken for granted sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while start up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europe general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points it went on sale in the us in mid november priced and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of to get the device with more than two million pre orders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters a action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine wireless capabilities it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top down map and the ability to switch weapons it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating super mario ds is a faithful re creation of the nintendo classic with a host of new mini games and new levels the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine one thing is for certain hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks
tech	china blocks google news sitechina has been accused of blocking access to google news by the media watchdog reporters without borders the paris based pressure group said the english language news site had been unavailable for the past days it said the aim was to force people to use a chinese edition of the site which according to the watchdog does not include critical reports google told the bbc news website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes china is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world a net police force monitors websites and e mails and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information popular chinese portals such as sina com and sohu com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments and all net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive china is censoring google news to force internet users to use the chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports said the group in a statement by agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government google has let itself be used by beijing it said for its part the search giant said it was looking into the issue it appears that many users in china are having difficulty accessing google news sites in china and we are working to understand and resolve the issue said a google spokesperson google news gathers information from some news sources headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm with no human editorial intervention it offers editions of the service including one tailored for china and one for hong kong google launched a version in simplified chinese in september the site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information but google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within china as this would result in broken links
tech	a question of trust and technologya major government department is without e mail for a week and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happened a couple of weeks ago i wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days it seems that thousands of civil servants at the uk department of work and pensions went through the same thing last week it has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way depriving staff of e mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances senior consultants from eds the computer firm which manage the system and microsoft which supplied the software were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all while staff resorted to phone fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done fortunately the back office systems which actually pay people their money were still working so only new claims and updates were affected done properly this is bad enough for those affected but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners i am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans although the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows to windows xp went wrong and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network this is certainly unfortunate but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved today computer networks are large complex and occasionally fragile the interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems it is the network equivalent of godel theorem any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically so i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck what is really disturbing and cannot be excused is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press it is without a doubt a major story and was the second or third lead item on bbc radio today programme throughout friday morning so why did not the prime minister official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before friday why was not the pensions minister in parliament to make an emergency statement on tuesday when it was clear that there was a serious problem if there had been an outbreak of legionnaire disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment while eds and microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain we can learn some political lessons too and the most important is that in this digital world technology failures are matters of public interest not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice care or understand that means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it it would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege a major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently anything less is a betrayal of public trust bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
tech	call for action on internet scamphone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet rogue dialling scams according to premium phone line regulator icstis it has received complaints in recent months about dial up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users knowledge phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for they must warn people earlier about possible fraud icstis said people who use dial up connections can be affected by the scams without realising a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill icstis spokesman rob dwight said phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner if my bill goes over the usual a month i want to know about it straight away i do want to be told when it hit phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially inflated traffic he said we alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers he added telecoms ombudsman elizabeth france said certainly i would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if i do something out of the ordinary so i would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach the biggest phone company bt says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because under the current system once the call has been made there little that can be done gavin patterson group managing director for bt consumer said we do look at customer calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary we looking at the moment at whether we can improve this but as bt handled million calls a day monitoring was quite a task in itself he added the government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future at the moment it cannot demand pay outs on the behalf of customer it can only close illegal services down i use free anti virus software avg and free firewall protection zonealarm both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter love of music sites how about isps informing all customers of such facilities the responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues ignorance is and always has been an expensive business does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently so are these people followed up and prosecuted these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal mp porn and pirated software if people did visit such sites they be considerably less at risk whatever happened to personal responsibility it seems everyone has to be a victim these days ! part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems a secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user knowledge these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them they should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam goingwhy do bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer request to anyone who falls foul of this scam refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls after you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions they cannot insist on you paying the bill to do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud no customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead then you have nothing to worry about or buy some decent firewall software and anti virus you would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat you would not drive your car without any insurance so why not protect your pc stop blaming the phone companies it not their fault ! i was very impressed with our phone company recently i had kept ringing a hotline number for kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if i was aware there were odd calls to the same number great service and i got the tickets as well ! i have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam he informed the phone company about it they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers three months later another huge bill of over came in the block apparently did work and he still has to pay for it even though a block was in place phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill otherwise they be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem i have been scammed of the operator will do nothing about this and to add insult to injury i was charged vat by the government premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented one example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid the telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly i know people who have run up large bills despite being it literate from talking to bt in belfast i believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing it not the fault of phone companies and at last they are doing something about it it about time that the profiteering by the legitimate phone companies came to an end mainly by doing away with dial up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial up ! not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly i have fallen victim to a rogue dialling scam but i think you seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography in most cases the user is entirely at fault which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them my telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal to to this was because of the scam they simply billed me what particularly galls me over and above having over stolen is that the supplier and the government through vat are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses how about an automatic monthly cap of say on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted that way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage at least any disputed amount would be limited far easier for a telecoms operator to write off than it is a few years back i was also the target of such scams but thank god i have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all i heard was the sound of an attempted connection how about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti virus and firewall software is up to date that should prevent the vast majority of these scams
tech	screensaver tackles spam websitesnet users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websitesinternet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e mail lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data we never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do said malte pollmann spokesman for lycos europe in the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users he said but now we are going to go one step further we found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers by getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity mr pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with he said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day he said about one mp file but he said if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day lycos did not want to use e mail to fight back said mr pollmann that would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing he said the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day the list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real time blacklists generated by organisations such as spamcop to limit the chance of mistakes being made lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs the burden of high bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive said mr pollmann sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver while working the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data the screensaver is due to be launched across europe on december and before now has only been trialled in sweden despite the soft launch mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than times in the last four days there a huge user demand to not only filter spam day by day but to do something more he said before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive

tech	online commons to spark debateonline communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust says the institute of public policy research ippr existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services says the think tank although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate in its report is online community a policy tool the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities adopting an ebay type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection what we are proposing is a civic commons will davies senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication like a pre legislation discussion the idea of a civic commons was originally proposed by stephen coleman professor of e democracy at the oxford internet institute the ippr report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist it mentions good practice public initiatives like the bbc ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues but he adds government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too proposals for id cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer to peer interaction online at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services said mr davies but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other reputation by how they treat other members using a similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built this could mean a civic commons would work within a non market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly recognised rules e government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues with of uk households now with access to the net the government suggests mr davies could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic non market interactions said mr davies there is a role for public bodies like the bbc libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of cliques talking to each other he added the paper is part of the ippr digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain

tech	ban hits half life pirates hardabout people have been banned from playing the half life game game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally copies of half life had been circulating on file sharing systems soon after it was officially released experts said the success of the half life anti piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version half life was officially released on november but before gamers could get to grips with the long awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online authentication involved setting up an account with valve gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half life read the statement valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the represented one effect of steam popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game ranking in the top ten even so the title debuted at no in the uk charts valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve anti piracy actions in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half life keys copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game just to catch pirates and cheats were false the company said the hack came from the community as do they all it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half life circulating on file swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys rob fahey editor of online news site gamesindustry biz said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system before now he said it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played but with this valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half life he said if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum said mr fahey other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems it not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games he said this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam type systems that are used to batter people with adverts unless game firms were careful he said they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play

tech	smartphones suffer skulls attackowners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper those downloading the software could find all the icons on their phone swapped for images of skulls when installed the malicious program also locks many of the functions making it hard to use and harder to repair the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones the file nicknamed skulls is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add ons such as wallpaper games and ringtones for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the phone the skulls program is labelled as a file called extended theme manager zip once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications such as contacts calendar notebook etc with non working versions so the phone becomes almost useless the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it one of which includes ignoring a security warning symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself despite this finnish anti virus lab f secure said it had sporadic reports of owners being caught out by it the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee symbian phones produced by sony ericsson motorola benq arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program
tech	musical future for phonesanalyst bill thompson has seen the future and it is in his son hands i bought my son max a phone partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone and partly because i am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought i should see how they work in real life after using it for a while i am not at all tempted to get rid of my sonyericsson p smart phone that has a relatively large screen even if it does only have slower gprs access to the network i can read my e mail surf the web using a proper browser and write stuff using the stylus on its touch screen last week someone e mailed me a document that had been compressed into a zip file and i was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me by contrast the confusing menus complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max phone simply get in the way and i did not see much value in the paid for services especially the limited web access the videos of entertainment news horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal and i did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image never mind micro tv but then max started playing and i realised i was missing the point entirely it is certainly not a great overall experience but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout the video content itself is compelling the quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the bbc website and the image is about the same size max was completely captivated and i was intrigued to discover that i had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution it is easy to be dismissive of small screens and indeed anyone of my generation with failing eyesight and the view that there never anything worth watching on tv is hardly going to embrace these phones but just as the world wide web was the killer application that drove internet adoption music videos are going to drive adoption with vodafone now pushing its own service and already established in the uk video on the phone is clearly going to become a must have for kids sitting on the school bus adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress this will please the network operators who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired licences but it goes deeper than that playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the ownload and play model we have all accepted for our ipods and mp players after all why should i want to carry of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want whenever i want streamed to my phone oh and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts something which ensures that it is always in someone pocket or handbag available for other uses too i have never really approved of using the internet protocol ip to do either audio or video streaming and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ip but i have to acknowledge that the net at least here in the developed western countries is fast and reliable enough to do both i stream radio to my computer while i work and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that i can find online but nowhere else i am even playing with internet telephony despite my reservations and i appear on go digital on the world service streamed over the web each week but networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming both for voice and video which gives them an edge over net based ip services the services are quite there yet and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges vodafone will let you access its services on vodafone live ! as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites this one for example this will not matter to business users but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company collection of partner sites something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator ofcom but we should not see these new phones simply as cut down network terminals if i want fast access to my e mail i can get a card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network the phone is a lot more and it is as a combination of mini tv personal communications device and music video player that it really works there is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices accessing a wide range of services over different networks phones and ipods can co exist at least for a while but if i had to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both an mp player anyonebill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
tech	multi purpose tv aids indiatwo thirds of the world population billion people live on a year or less you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer but that not the case many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a tv and now an indian born computer engineer thinks he come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might i come from a village says prof reddy i know what the population is like many of them are illiterate and many of them have other concerns there nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a pc word processing and powerpoint he said so it clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment education telemedicine and access to expert advice prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach after all he asked what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to million less fortunate indians let alone the billions of poor people around the worldinstead prof reddy decided to think of those million indians as a potential market the problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this prof reddy says people do this today with television sets if you go to india and many other countries they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal why because personalized entertainment has become very important this hatched a completely new idea he calls it a pctvt a personal computer television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control on the screen pictures not words designate applications like tv voice mail and video e mail this dependence on graphics video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs times more power and more memory than one for a phd prassana rambathla one of prof reddy graduate students says that when you talking illiterate you talking audio and video and that demands exponentially high bandwidth it ca choke at any point in time and it has to withstand anything no matter what you pressing the major part is making it foolproof very tough so that it never breaks he says the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have built in audio and video hardware and software limited trials of the pctvt are due to start this month in the indian state of andhra pradesh although andhra pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley the answer says prof brewer is wi fi we looking at the thing you see in starbuck or many other hotspots he says we doing a lot of work on long distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency when the power goes up and down and the links go up and down and the computers you connected to just get turned off for no reason prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about a month and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt other technologies such as video mail for example a farmer could use the pctvt webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay off the underlying problem he says is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy and improve their health care and what im postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them if i did have it it would be an uphill battle even with the technology it an uphill battle but i have a tool there is hope i can reach them in ways that have not been possible before clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production

tech	toxic web links help virus spreadvirus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code those clicking on the poisoned links in e mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus the trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti virus software that combs through code contained in e mail attachments the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on november they exploit a windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier like many other recent viruses bofra plunders the address book in microsoft outlook for e mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e mail messages to potential victims but unlike many other recent viruses does not itself travel via mail instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that when clicked on connect back to the machine that distributed that e mail essentially bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus the messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a paypal transaction copies of the messages seen by the bbc news website had bright yellow and green backgrounds those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down in the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e mail messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread finnish anti virus firm f secure said that so far it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation tim warner spokesman for anti virus firm finjan said you have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating mr warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code most firms have secured their e mail gateway said mr warner but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways he said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims the bofra family of viruses which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug can infect machines running windows me nt xp and server users running windows xp that have applied the sp update are not vulnerable to the loophole that bofra exploits

tech	lifestyle governs mobile choicefaster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in depth study by handset maker ericsson historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson consumer and enterprise lab we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website for the study ericsson interviewed mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone people habits remain the same said dr bjorn they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it a much more convenient way to do it one good example of this was diary writing among younger people he said while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone especially one equipped with a camera helps them keep it in a different form youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles ericsson research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists only when about of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop however he said now of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month in the figure was similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise in only of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month now the figure is similar rises have been seen in many other european nations dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life

tech	gritty return for prince of persiastill basking in the relatively recent glory of last year sands of time the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within and in a more bellicose mood than last time this sequel gives the franchise a grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence as before you control the super athletic prince from a third person perspective the time travelling plot hinges on the dahaka an all consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast creation studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to old fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be ever since the series then groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulously animated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect combining them at speed is the best fun although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill until you reach that point it is a haphazard business all too often you will perform a stunning triple somersault pirouette off a wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before the game developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off warrior within is a very slick package the game intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences it is on a par with the jaw dropping opening sequence of onimusha earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anti climax that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game the music is probably the worst aspect a merit free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for

tech	lifestyle governs mobile choicefaster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in depth study by telecommunications company ericsson historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson consumer and enterprise lab we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website for the study ericsson interviewed mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone people habits remain the same said dr bjorn they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it a much more convenient way to do it one good example of this was diary writing among younger people he said while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone especially one equipped with a camera helps them keep it in a different form youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles ericsson research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists only when about of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop however he said now of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month in the figure was similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise in only of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month now the figure is similar rises have been seen in many other european nations dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life
