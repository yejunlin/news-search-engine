of the peso decade long peg to the us dollar in february the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people life savings disappear scathes of companies went bust three years ago every sector of the economy was hit by the crisis said entrepreneur drayton valentine it really was dire but since then the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil agriculture and tourism are helping said entrepreneur drayton valentine mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina was fortunate at the time of the crisis his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad but now he is using his money to help with the start up a trading company he explained that initially his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states then he would like to diversify to other areas depending on the market locally there is a sense of recovery many companies are exporting now he said noting that a lot of firms which were closed during the crisis are re opening but not all that shines is gold argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of president nestor kirchner administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors but with the debts nominal value standing at around it is not proving easy debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate argentina current offer implies that the creditors would get just cents for each dollar they are owed according to the creditors understandably they want more and until they do both they and others are loath to continue lending for president kirchner this proves a hopeless challenge real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay observed jack boorman adviser to imf managing director rodrigo rato everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached he said the cost is enormous and continues to be paid and will not be reversed by any restructuring with the international negotiations being troubled it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina said carlos baez silva president of aara an association that represents bank account and bond holders few people have recovered more than about half their savings mr baez silva estimated pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe a lot of them invested in good faith he said the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the country legal system on occasion the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents he says insisting that the system cannot be trusted people have to deposit their money in the banks not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina agreed if i have to save pesos the local currency there is not much problem but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank

! ! best song in years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but really ! listened to angels on radio this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfection ! as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last years that deserve this award more it not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low im actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last years ! ! what about the specials ghost town the buzzcocks ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy division love will tear us apart angels is middle of the road rubbish angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap it musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result is very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music ! best of the last years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last years after all it alright for a pop song but the best song of the last yearsthere is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last years it a travesty rubbish ! who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio but i do recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who would know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out where on earth did this dreadful list appear fromwhile i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last years should not include songs less than years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show you got to be kidding angels is a great song but not the best song of the last years only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i do think its the best song from the past years ! right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song is that good ! im happy for robbie himself though ! best song in the last years what a joke ! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins does deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it proof that music and democracy just do mix still at least it was will young oh it all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously ! robbie has millions of loyal fans while even non fans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent ! i hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and no one to slow dance with ! i agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbie i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels is really that good a song it certainly is anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush angels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers it a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best we forget about the late and early for example they were cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think yes angels is the best song since the past years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning i always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre teens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting it orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who do particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing it is merely an irritating distraction a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it you should feel ashamed of yourself you probably only know a dozen songs or so do you so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisssangels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century no surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven year old girl perhaps i mean will young come on what a load of crap best song in the last years i do think so ! ! what about all the real artists out there over the last years the list is endless but robbie williams does even come close what a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radio off why a half baked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last years ! ! ! ! i think not i did realize radio had so many listeners under the age of ! ! people have such short memories ! a great song yes but the best of the last years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here the great british public at work again it a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted it not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nope no because im not female and im not ! ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past years ! the shortlist was great but him winning it is a joke ! predictable and laughable the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie repertoire never mind best song of the last years i am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list have radio listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last years than robbie williams ever will no doubt about it there not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song it should have been joy division those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today yes ! ! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win ! robbie was a deserved winner i am astounded that such a second rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs ! it a terrible song voted for by the masses who do have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music the best song of the past years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose it confirmed one thing the british public are consistently dull lt no offence robbie but pleeease ! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin ! i think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he does deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust ! ! obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it if this is the best song of the last years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record a sad day for musicit not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people that why it has been voted best song of the last years it a good all rounder just like robbie best song in years since im confused angels is a bad song it a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything it regressive bland even i suppose it just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become granted angels is a good song however it really was up against any other proper competition the queen song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic ! also why were the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angels i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie was getting more awards so they had to make one up for him ! best song of the last years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it was bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful angels is without doubt a great song but i really do think it deserves the title of best song in years perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song ! ! ! do get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners it would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past years ! im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially populari nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near u new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit no surprise really it voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in musicpersonally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard ! it absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come it an absolute joke however most of the original were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise ! the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it did end up in the hands of will young though although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talent although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that all it means !

entertainment	brits debate over urban musicjoss stone a year old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is im not really comfortable with the word urban it a word that been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it wrong how far are the brits removed from inner city music and what people are doing it so far removed that i do expect them to get it bang on the music industry is championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people do feel like that anything to do with us i do feel like urban music just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that there an urban music scene because it all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day it not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she signed to then so be it it got nothing to do with what really going on urban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hip hop r b garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub genres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that she a uk artist what has really captured everybody imagination is that here you have a year old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good i think that what done it the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base i do think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that she from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she literally rural the great thing about urban music is that there a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think that where you can call it urban that where this new sub category or uber category has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you could argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real that the only cut off point we have here and that the only way by which we judge people what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race does make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award a type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life she might not be urban but when did r b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now r b stands for rhythm and blues remember ! that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hip hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claimshe definitely deserved to win a prize joss stone albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who were nominated or did win i cant see why people ca just congratulate her for the talent that she is she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and r b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange what in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term ance music is misleading because it does describe everything you can dance to whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties i been to good luck to joss stone let celebrate her victory let also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast we did see a single black artist on stage collecting an award so what you saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who is black and if it is then they should be acknowledged for it even if they pretty dam good at it she has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but she not black well let make her feel real bad about it then how dare she ! though hang on did the so called public vote on this onethis idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the and in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth it a lazy term to categorise music that you do really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents i demand a prize for rural music ! sucks to the cities it way better out here we have hay for one thing excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black toohow can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense i love joss to bits and do care what her branding is it amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and let just call it music and let especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that stylethe term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul rnb and hip hop one which does not also mean something else as we have done with crunk urban is just a word that come about recently to describe black music that become popular now the word was even in use or common use five of six years ago it just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it im in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label i hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because that all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc who ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos but why not britsso what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stone talent but why did jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people ! you have said it there is music you like and music you do like who cares what label you put on itthat entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i do think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams urban is a nonsense term music of black origin well does that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in london manchester etc and does that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it does make any sense why does music have to be put into a genre it music you like it or you do simple as that i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musically urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i do know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as they a white rock band they wo be described as such joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though there only two kinds of music good and bad

politics	could rivalry overshadow electiontony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift ian gibson for example urged the two men to stop squabbling declaring for goodness sake sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re election tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster a behind closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears and it matters little whether the rift is real or as some try to suggest simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip few in westminster actually believe that simply because the evidence appears to contradict it for example the weekend attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments mr blair talked about the new labour manifesto a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor who has long rejected the label and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year that claim was repeated in robert peston book a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act for his part mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re elected the trouble is both men have fallen short of offering simple straightforward denials of the central claims so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere they started with and are sustained by friends of the two men one only had to listen to the chancellor friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister apparent attempts to confound mr brown leadership ambitions but it is not just public pronouncements from ex aides there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides it is no secret in westminster for example that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner then there are the actions of the men themselves gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter which they believe is a media only obsession or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry either way there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation but with probably only four months to the next election that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off

politics	labour mps fears over squabblingif there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election as one hugely disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting it is time they realised it not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand as paul flynn said what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect stephen pound echoed the message saying we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the labour party but for this country is the appearance of division we remember the they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown stead and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors even mr prescott admitted that had he still been a backbencher he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good or can even be sustained through the campaign remains to be seen even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for a week the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be new labour through and through similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said none the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp effectively strengthening the prime minister hand for example will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past what all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign mind you we have heard similar pledges before

politics	howard taunts blair over splitstony blair feud with gordon brown is damaging the way the uk is governed tory leader michael howard has claimed in a heated prime minister questions mr howard asked how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other that question was later unveiled as the headline for new tory campaign posters but mr blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by labour he can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages low inflation low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to he said the chancellor is currently on a high profile tour of africa to highlight new anti poverty plans but before doing so he insisted he still trusted mr blair despite claims to the contrary in a new book brown britain by robert peston says there is mutual animosity between the two men it claims mr blair said in november he would stand down as prime minister before the next election but he went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him it says mr peston book claimed that mr brown told mr blair there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe mr blair directly denied that quote on wednesday he again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit the tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor he declared he is the deals on meals prime minister no wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater he continued how can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government how can they clean up our hospitals when they do clean up their act mr blair said he would not respond to tittle tattle in books and promised to hail labour record on the economy waiting lists and law and order from now until polling day later at their poster launch tory co chairman liam fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how juvenile the prime minister and chancellor were labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on tuesday where mr brown was joined by alan milburn who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor but liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc news the government is clearly split at the top this kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody later this week mr blair is expected to outline the direction of his party next election manifesto the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made mr peston book
politics	how political squabbles snowballit become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they and their supporters need to grow up and stop bickering but this analysis in fact gets it wrong it not just children who fight adults do too and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they be better off if it ended but everyone wants to have the last word each participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die now this is because the participants are stupid it actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them indeed there even a piece of economic theory that explains all this nothing as obscure as post neo classical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with it often referred to as the prisoner dilemma based on a parable much told in economics degree courses about a sheriff and two prisoners the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime without a confession the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk he tells each prisoner separately that if they confess and they are the only one to confess they be let off their crime and he tells them that if they do confess and they are the only one not to confess they get life now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess if your partner does confess you get off completely and if your partner does confess you better confess to ensure you do get life the result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up do worry if you do entirely follow it you can to look it up on google where there are entries on it the prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly a cold war arms race for example a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms rather than a lot of arms but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high what economics tells us is that once you in a prisoners dilemma unless you are repeating the experience many times over it hard to escape the perverse logic of it it no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on somehow the incentives have to change in the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest solomon wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants an example is the famous rule that one divides the other chooses as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in if the rest of the party can enforce that they have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly
politics	blair looks to election campaigntony blair big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign that poll may still be about weeks away but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto there was a detailed account of the government past record with a major emphasis on the economy and public services there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly new labour although that may continue to irritate his chancellor there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges although the prime minister talked about a new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society his was more a speech designed to remind people and some in his own party precisely what new labour stood for and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach and for some that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something that it is as he said more than an electoral device to that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in and stuck with it possibly through some gritted teeth in and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters in a key section he declared in our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity for the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability every family not just the fortunate few knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship every adult including those who missed out at school able to get the skills then need to advance home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions under what is to be the general election slogan britain is working the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour that might get under the skin of mr brown but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post war chancellor britain has had probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men in so far as there is one is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services an unremittingly new labour manifesto as the prime minister is happy to make plain will stress the importance of that the belief patients and parents for example want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and in particular the use of that little three letter word but for now all eyes have been focused on the next general election and for many in westminster mr blair performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on may

politics	ukip secret weaponby any measure new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else a winner this is the man who some pundits believe was almost single handedly responsible for bill clinton sensational comeback victory but morris is no ideologue he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and more recently politicians from mexico to uruguay now he is back in london as the uk independence party not so secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped you guessed it opposition candidate viktor yushchenko if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances that he enjoys the game more than the politics so why britain and why ukip which despite its recent eu election successes is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election on this subject morris appears almost evangelical i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and coincidentally so was ukip leader roger knapman i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism a great soundbite but a surprise coming from a new yorker post september it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better who do believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined that international bankers the world trade organisation the international monetary fund the world bank and primarily the european union so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable the tory party is schizophrenic about europe but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they ca possibly re negotiate anything as michael howard is pledged to do it like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody possibly a very american analogy but another great soundbite the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it so is ukip job to destroy the tories as former member robert kilroy silk once notoriously declared no the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move but it not just to shift the tories i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro and while we are on the subject of mr kilroy silk mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites robert kilroy silk is not a team player it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one so what is the big plan for the general election how will he achieve the breakthrough look we are not going to be forming the next government he said neither does ukip have to fight every seat as with the us presidential election he says the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats just as he believes it will in britain so with limited resources the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll the internet was a decisive factor in the presidential election through blogs individuals posting their views in online diaries people just did it anything can happen in the next general election there is an inherent instability at the moment labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice that might he suggests lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power it is a huge task surely but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises even while most still believe it is labour for the taking ukip performance in last year european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus and after all he has a reputation to sustain

politics	defection timed to hit tax pledgewith impeccable and precisely calculated timing tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard latest announcement on taxation and spending with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories resolutely depressing poll showings the big idea is his savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc one breakfast with frost programme he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now but without any concrete pledges but mr howard announced that of the he has earmarked from savings will be used to plug labour claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin first budget he would not be precise but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax but he did for the first time say there would be such tax cuts at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less it is the tories attempt to open that famed clear blue water between them and the labour party and return to a traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact mr howard however was dismissive these things happen from time to time there are disagreements between robert jackson and me the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did he added and that is certainly true the election will be decided on the economy stupid other issues like the iraq war and the trust thing will also play a major part but it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda mr howard knows that risks accusations that as a result he would slash public services so he has attempted to shoot that fox first with polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts he has suggested that is exactly what he will do whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen
politics	tory leader unveils spending plantory leader michael howard says his party can save in government spending by tackling waste the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps robert jackson a former minister to labour mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election let be realistic the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did he told bbc breakfast with frost programme however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives spending plans fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday the bulk of the saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services mr howard said the left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing he added however the remainder would deal with some of the unfair taxes almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes mr howard insisted because borrowing is going up it is out of control that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both so part of the we are going to apply to filling the government black hole reducing the borrowing the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today mr howard is expected to say that around will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble shooter david james home office spending could be cut by according to the final instalment of his year long review savings of at the foreign office and at the department for culture media and sport have also been identified in all almost a quarter of a million jobs and public bodies would go under mr james proposals mr howard said all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less however chief treasury secretary paul boateng said none of the tories figures add up so they ca make these savings and ca pay for any tax cuts which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is of cuts hitting frontline public services hard liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added people will not be taken in by michael howard claims of worth of savings this ca be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities a poll for the news of the world newspaper suggests the conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century labour will hold key marginal constituencies winning a majority of the populus survey suggests and the liberal democrats will take three key seats from the conservatives leaving the tories with just mps two less than they returned atlabour landslide and their worst showing since
politics	kennedy looks to election gainsthey may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition but the liberal democrats are entering the expected election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his party ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson that only his party offered a genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self delusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name

politics	lib dems bold election policycharles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two with his party previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government he has switched tack now he is promising to levy a modest increase of the same amount on earnings over a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges they are to scrap student fees finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax that last policy will also see about of the most well off paying more while others pensioners in particular will pay less labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through efficiency savings while labour has offered savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals although there is little chance they will propose increases in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the and early but unlike the old tory labour debate he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howard proposals for quotas once again with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration mr kennedy is stressing the different more liberal approach of his party mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party election chances declaring the tories were not going to be significant players in the poll he repeated his pledge not to do post election deals with either party after the election mr kennedy went on to suggest the re election of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a massive vote of no confidence in tony blair government that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before
politics	kennedy cautious optimismcharles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election in his years in the commons he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and he might say the uk political and electoral system but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months time look i have already said i am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around he said he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the real opposition but does that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second he is prepared to go this far a clear conclusion has been reached including by conservatives that the conservatives are not going to win this election therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced but have we been here before with suggestions in the that labour was finished wo voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives the problem is that geographically the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain we have supplanted them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain and they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britain mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters he insists his three headline commitments to be financed from a tax increase on those earning over a year will appeal right across the political spectrum they are to replace the council tax with a local income tax provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to old labour i think the tax argument has moved on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election he said under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise while the tories plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible he claims we are being straightforward with people saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies that is a clear cut choice for people one i am very comfortable with and i think will distinguish us from the others as to his own future he is clear if as expected his party increases its showing at the election he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us that last remark reflects a view gaining ground in westminster that if the tories do as badly as some fear the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party perhaps then mr kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side

enough evidence to put them on trial lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties but thriller writer frederick forsyth tells bbc news of his personal response to the move there is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of britain or so says home secretary charles clarke my reaction so what it is not that i am cynical or just do not care i care about this country very much but in the years that i have been alive there has not been one hour of one day of one month of one year when there has not been a threat aimed at us my point is the british have always coped without becoming a dictatorship we have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat but that is what the blair government now seeks to do create a tyranny to defend us from the al qaeda tyranny i was born on august the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler a week after my first birthday the threat had become reality we were at war my father wore a uniform for five years after we yearned for peace at last but in winston churchill told us from the baltic to the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across europe behind the iron curtain another genocidal psychopath another threat josef stalin triggered the cold war with the berlin blockade in my whole generation was blighted by it we were threatened by the nuclear holocaust the nuclear wind the nuclear winter we built shelters that would have sheltered nothing we spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals we took silly precautions some fought it some marched futilely against it some pretended it was not there the cold war lasted years but we remained a parliamentary democracy by the early seventies it was terrorism as well al fatah black september red brigades but most of all for us the ira and the inla thirty more years policemen and women over soldiers more than civilians dead but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny that was why the tyrants lost civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources yes and one judge no jury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle but habeas corpus did not die right of appeal was not abolished now the threat is islamic fundamentalism its leaders want to destroy our society so did the ira it is based and funded abroad so was the ira it has sleeper fanatics inside our society so did the ira it is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents so was the ira the prime movers are not easy to bring to trial neither were the ira but we did and without becoming a tyranny now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge but the whim of a political activist called a government minister to be protected from terror the government says we must become a tyranny but a tyranny is based on the citizen terror this is not victory this is defeat before a shot is fired an interesting article its good to see widening participation in the debate but i suggest we move one step further our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace because invading foreign nations imprisoning the innocent and hunting in the hadows cannot destroy an evil of the mind and hatred within the heart rather than focusing upon effect we should consider the cause because terrorism does not begin with bombs why not try a foreign policy of compassion it can only enhance our democracy and share our freedom i agree with frederick forsyth we really ca deal with terrorism by turning britain into a fascist state what we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial there probably is any our security services behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it while the real villain gets away remember there were no wmd in iraq just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist in this overly politically correct society it is good to see someone like mr forsyth speak out yes there has been oppression by the british government in the past and overstepping the mark in places like ireland but yes we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge trial etc apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal for example this country signs up to human rights and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear the innocent people defined by whom when id cards become mandatory the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act and will be readily available to people like gchq with no control by the person whose id is being checked the threat now is new you cannot compare the threats of past years with now forsyth says died over years or terrorism people died in one morning in ny on september the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology a kilo of semtex will flatten a building a kilo of plutonium will flatten a city you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible i agree the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass hysteria and talking up the threat but talking down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too the problem with this issue is not that it is important but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times that we will just let this go without telling the government no however as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far as somebody of chinese origin i can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life whilst life was perfect we could make better for ourselves now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do we have to be politically correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions we have a prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions let hope the bbc does get gagged for letting people express their views the people have the right to know and the bbc role is to inform educate and entertain i agree terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties in the end the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy the terrorists have already won i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate the idea that the new terrorism demands new powers is erroneous the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk is scant ricin for example is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear if the government has its way with id cards tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not we will have lost the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court that goes right back to magna carta and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they knew best when you look at today britain you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing the date frederick forsyth puts it beautifully the government is seeking to introduce a police state the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases together with the un british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of years we are sleep walking into this wake up ! an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it because these terrorists are potentially so deadly we have to come up with new tougher responses it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked we wo have much of a society left to debate ! he correct in most of what he says mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young catholics to join the ira administrative detention of muslims could have a similar effect now surely we the public would be better protected if the security services rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest and for how longthey were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack i do usually have much time for mr forsyth largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the u k but it is very doubtful whether al qaeda is a global organisation co ordinating this the rise of surveillance cameras id cards the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times this is the stuff of nightmares add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit where will this end as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u k it government will soon have it people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs mr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation but could not verbalise thank you mr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides he also forgets basic human rights were suspended then as now experienced judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times for very little return and maximum alienation these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same forsyth is wrong the nature of the current threat is new it is no longer to our armed forces as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc was it is to you and i the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately the best comparison is therefore the blitz at this time let us not forget suspects foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war without any complaints from the public we must not forget we are at war i say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major uk target is a when not an if probability i bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government did do enough to protect the uk people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live is under attack not from terrorists but from this government the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the alleged terrorists are doing but from our own government i believe what this government is doing is at the very least highly questionable and at worst sinister at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles when we are all tagged and monitored constantly our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing it should be of great concern to everyone i am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one i think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism how true there are extremely worrying parallels between britain now and germany during the i never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within mr forsyth has forgotten one key point the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler stalin and the ira all failed as a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat that should always be the absolute last resort but to meet the new threat to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today terrorists we may need to do things a little differently let us hope not frederic forsythe comments seem to me to be a well thought out analysis of why we human society as a whole and britain in particular should resist the temptation to over protect through fear it is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end and terrorists can come in all forms as mr forsythe opening comments suggest i am reminded of a quote attributed to thomas jefferson a nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither the government are faced with an incredibly difficult task and have made a policy to deal with it it all very well criticising that policy but if mr forsythe ca draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative i say so what to his opinions frederick forsyth rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable he distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist because he does not appreciate the need for balance i rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth but in this instance i think he is correct the rule of law must prevail civil liberties are worth defending if the government can hold uspects without charge or trial what nexti agree absolutely by introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror our democratic system is not perfect but as churchill points out it is better than all the others that have been tried terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom i do not usually agree with mr forsyth but he is spot on here the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose totalitarianism always requires an outside threat justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation although in principle i agree with him frederick forsyth fails to address one key point al qaeda attacks though obviously there have been none yet in the uk seek to kill the maximum number of people the ira wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement yes i agree with mr forsyth views i do not believe the government plans are justified there is over reaction to and the negative influence of the us president interpretation of democracy and freedom he uses the same arguments that were current before the wwii the wars to liberate iraq afghanistan with syria and iran to come we are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations mr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who mr forsyth seems to be putting along side the cruffy little austrian thomas hobbes would be smiling in his grave at labour propositions like new labour he called himself a libertarian like new labour he believed he was promoting the people best interests but as forsythe criticises this government hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians simply put he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty the liberty to live man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign as protection against his fellow barbaric man hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity and rightly so i hope new labour suffers the same treatment i agree with mr forsyth views the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy they must not be allowed to get away with it of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny has he forgotten about shoot to kill torture internment without trial collusion with loyalist death squads etcmy background is somewhat similar to freddie so i am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive it is unfortunately also the first step towards totalitarianism who is to decide whom is a suspect why should we believe them who can have faith in the honesty integrity and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years what is to stop false denunciations what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers who will support their families will their children still go to school it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany stalin russia ceausescu romania the list goes on it looks as if a new dark age is coming i see that opinion on mr forsyth remarks are divided the problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family only to people they do like or are scared of but history has shown that if you have laws like that they always get abused by those in power after all today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you ! and that day you be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces you have to be shown to be deserving of it if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period we are no better that those we are fighting i never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth but im in wholehearted agreement with him on this one we as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda which of course also means we inherit most if not all of their total paranoia and allow our governments of any political persuasion incidentally to gradually and insidiously impose a police state by well tried tested back door methods i grieve for the future of my children it no wonder they adamant they do ever want any of their own this government with much fanfare signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial this puts it on a par with the government of burma like many of your respondents i would usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share but in the instance of opposing charles clark proposals for house arrest i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i agree with mr forsyth just look at the facts our government along with the us invaded another sovereign country iraq by selecting intelligence that backed it case based on fear the facts turned out to be very different if individuals are treated in the same distorted way then we done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs we become animals too i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent it is hypocrisy of the highest order mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism to the new threat however it appears that he has misunderstood the term islamic fundamentalism it should be pointed out that a muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the quraan and the teachings of the last prophet muhammad is an islamic fundamentalist this person does not commit suicide in any shape or form nor does she he kill innocent women men and children this person is self reflective and constantly tries to better her his actions by being good to others the people who mr forsyth labels the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam they have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions on top of that they claim to be following islam in its true form ! i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference in northern ireland internment certainly did achieve anything the bombings did stop and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london it is easy to agree with him he is absolutely spot on during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf to the right of where i write this and also to the left in the city of london notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of downing street there was no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there has been on afghanistan and iraq even when england was in true peril in apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like we have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including id cards which winston churchill decided had to go since he said the average bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities incidentally i can still remember my old id card number hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered what can i add to mr forsyth eloquently put arguments except applause ! well done that man for standing up and being counted in the war against tyranny

politics	ukip mep attacked german empirea uk independence party mep suggested germany saw the eu as an empire and was cheaper than using tanks a new documentary has revealed mike nattrass ukip deputy leader made the comments to an audience at a meeting during last september hartlepool by election campaign but challenged on the remark he denied accusing germany of using the eu as cover for a german reich he says he was not german bashing but saying peace was the eu founding aim the meeting was shown in a bbc film on ex ukip mep robert kilroy silk the former chat show host quit the party earlier this month calling it a joke the documentary showed mr nattrass apparently talking about the eu telling the meeting the germans are the big losers here but they do care because to them the project is worthwhile it like an empire for them spreading in all directions away from germany into hungary into what they call the sudetenland czechoslovakia places like that so it cheaper for them to do it this way than roll the tanks in on tuesday he told the bbc news website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with meps of different nationalities in the european parliament he argued that peace was the only reason for having the outdated eu as there was no economic justification pointing to germany trade interests as a country in the centre of europe mr nattrass said the fact is that the eu benefits germany but it does not benefit britain im not at all german bashing it the truth a ukip spokesman said mike has some passionate beliefs and sometimes uses excessively colourful language with which to express them the documentary showed some of the tensions between mr kilroy silk and his fellow meps after ukip took third place in last year european elections he denied wanting to be leader until october when he told bbc one breakfast with frost programme he aspired to the job asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions mr kilroy silk said there was one thing i said that i should have said at the time i was trying to be helpful to the party and it was the wrong thing to do i should have told the truth the film also included footage of a row between mr kilroy silk mep nigel farage and party leader roger knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the ukip whip in the european parliament mr kilroy silk told them he had not left the ukip group a move he announced shortly after the meeting he told mr farage do tell lies nigel now you told too many most of the trouble had been caused by you ukip officials claim it was in fact mr kilroy silk not mr farage who briefed newspapers he was leaving the group of meps later in unguarded off air comments in a television studio mr kilroy silk was heard saying he was irritated by defending some of these right wing fascist nutters mr kilroy silk separately said he had argued against ukip working with such groups which believed homosexuality was a sin a ukip spokesman said there were more than meps in the same group in the european parliament they were from a broad spectrum some right wing some left wing but with a shared belief in the unfeasibility of the eu as it is now he did not defend other groups religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views just as mr kilroy silk had a right to criticise arab states london ukip mep gerard batten said robert has made a variety of comments about ukip and its meps there are of course two sides to every story what robert does not say is that he was offered several positions which would have given him effective control of the party but not the title of leader mr kilroy silk is to launch his own parry veritas in westminster on wednesday
politics	kilroy launches veritas partyex bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy silk said he wanted to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party mr kilroy silk who recently quit the uk independence party said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told a london news conference that veritas latin for truth would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk mr kilroy silk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining an already crowded field on the right of british politics on thursday mr kilroy silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukip chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left mr kilroy silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy silk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroy silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead veritas it the bnp in an expensive suit ! it all well and good robert kilroy silk claiming that veritas is a party that does believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the two horse race trend in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke screen for his anti islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy silk opposing geoff hoon ! ! good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done let hope kilroy silk ukip and the euro sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go not running away from it all mouth and trousers a clown trouble is any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term whatever kilroy silk and ukip do none of their anti european policies have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from right wing england but will have little impact in wales or scotland hopefully this all this fighting within euro sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better we ca rely on the usa forever ! at last an impetus for increasing the likely turn out for the election the electorate is disillusioned with british politics kilroy has one agenda the uk and i be voting for him both ukip and rk s are representatives of small mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people bickering that who in the overall scheme of things really cares about their petty tiffmany people believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls i always thought that kilroy silk was a self publicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion brilliant about time this country had a plausible party ! having seen the recent bbc documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action fantastic news pro europeans now have far less to worry about from the right the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid and the extreme anti europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local european and general elections robert kilroy silk ego and vanity are his own and his supporters worst enemy as a euro enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy silk behaviour he took a party that was just building up a head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup detat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two the closer to straight down the middle the better as far as i am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose we have ballot papers a mile long ! you got to hand it to kilroy silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self belief whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him i am also leaving ukip i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means the eu comments last week about michael howard plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states the sooner we leave this corrupt super state the betterdoes anyone else think that it is ironic that euro sceptic kilroy silk has used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british name is this indicative of the man contradictory vain and pompousi think mr kilroy silk has got a very good point british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped if mr kilroy silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote honestly who really cares man with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no idea as one of kilroy silk east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip democratic nature kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not he tried to make it work but they did seem to want to grow up he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy good luck to the man i say oh please ! this is an amusing irrelevance there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight what other politician can claim this i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like i shall be voting for him the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy silk but for the ukip kilroy silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip party list he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament i would write off kilroy silk while he a clown and a one man band at the moment he a populist and that always dangerous the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in success good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my country knight in shining armour he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today but people are almost too scared to express them kilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like me what more i look forward to the day when he claims victory wrecks the eu and rescues my great nation without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever ! great stuff the longer the uk dithers over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only english speaking country fully committed to europe oh and send us over those hard working immigrants our economy needs them this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further thank goodness that kilroy silk has gone now ukip at least has a chance in the election ! it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy silk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy silk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in fighting ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow !

politics	labour attacked on howard posterlabour has been accused of using anti semitic images in posters which critics claim depict tory leader michael howard as fagin the poster shows mr howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch saying i can spend the same money twice the image prompted concern from the editor of the jewish chronicle but labour insists it is simply anti tory labour later took the image off its website saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members the party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin with a blackboard reading the hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the dickens character fagin in the stage version of the musical oliver ! there was controversy over another poster choice offered to labour members it showed mr howard and mr letwin who are both jewish as flying pigs mr howard did not comment on the anti semitism claims when asked about the poster on monday instead he pointed to how tony blair had in complained about personalised abusive campaigning mr howard told greater manchester radio it is such a pity that mr blair does practise what he preaches jewish chronicle editor ned temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e mails from jewish chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image shylock and fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries old prejudice he told bbc radio world at one whatever the idea is i think it a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning mr temko said he blamed cock up not conspiracy saying he did not detect inherent anti semitism in any of the parties election campaigns the poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to labour members who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election labour mp louise ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti semitic when they only challenged tory economic policies labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said the poster had been misunderstood the image simply portrayed mr howard as a hypnotist he argued concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but i would emphasise that if you see the posters the common theme is that the tories are trying to con you a labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party website was not affected by the row this has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss he said but a conservative spokeswoman said this poster campaign which was offensive to many people was a big misjudgement by labour campaign team
politics	milburn defends poster campaignlabour election chief alan milburn has defended his party campaign posters amid tory claims the ads were nothing short of sly anti semitism mr milburn said he appreciated people concerns but insisted that what they were was anti tory and not in any way shape or form anti semitic he was responding to tory spokesman julian lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs a row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict michael howard who is jewish as fagin and as a flying pig amid claims they were anti semitic the posters were labelled a big misjudgement by the conservatives who said labour first shot in the election has badly backfired the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members who were asked to vote on their favourite labour has taken them off its website saying members preferred other posters the party four new designs launched on tuesday steer clear of the fagin or flying pig images but make clear that labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the tory leader personally with reminders of his record in office the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election in the commons tory spokesman mr lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded mps that labour chairman ian mccartney last year described shadow chancellor oliver letwin as a century fagin given the outrage that that smear caused then how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti semitism mr milburn replied that they were not anti semitic what they were was anti tory and i make no apologies at all for making clear to the british public exactly what the conservative plans would mean he said i fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the labour party website the fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off labour website on monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin holding a blackboard reading a labour spokesman later said their removal from the party website was not affected by the row

politics	immigration to be election issueimmigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time but no longer both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or alternatively running scared of addressing the problem but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry and to kick out more failed asylum seekers that has been attacked by the tories as too little too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a europe wide policy on immigration but while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers my concern is that whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate right wing political parties picking up on statements like `burden to britain will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty it is precisely that concern and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right racist agenda that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue the challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap

politics	campaign cold calls questionedlabour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioner office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run up to the general election but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but classic market research such as a poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said mr jones if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations in summary whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed mr jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue earlier lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them

politics	will tory tax cuts lift spiritsmichael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts should he win the next general election he has earmarked billion that will be used to reduce taxes although he still will not say which or how this was the pre election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax all the money would come from its billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that billion would go on spending plans with billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye catching before the election as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street labour needless to say claim his planned efficiency savings simply do add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy one of new labour greatest successes before the historic election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it is likely and the prime minister probably hopes that the economy will be the deciding factor

politics	will the budget bring out smiling votersas tory spokesman oliver letwin said any chancellor would use his pre election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners would he and everyone does indeed expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of may there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week budget the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories do desert him at the third poll and needless to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win but there is a shadow hanging over this pre election performance in the shape of billion or thereabouts that is the size of the financial black hole the tories backed by some independent forecasters believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash it was immediately denied but the tories remain suspicious claiming that as mr letwin said if the money does not come from there where will it come from mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election should labour win previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong he will argue while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy low unemployment and high public spending the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound increase spending and cut taxes at the same time the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy but based on increased taxes to fund spending and amongst other things abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election

politics	brown comes out shootinglabour may have abolished hunting but that did stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes specifically it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families in a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre election boost everyone had been predicting so if you are a couple with children a pensioner a patient or a youngster there was something pulled from mr brown red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government like a surgeon he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign the announcements brought great cheers from his own mps who are now in full on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps they obviously believed he had done that for them and coincidentally given his own image as a prime minister in waiting another little boost labour mps for example will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive a lovely old labour word this chancellor really is but gordon brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win labour an historic third term his demeanour remained quiet confident and reassuring prudence made an appearance albeit towards the end of his address as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to britain and which he claimed would be thrown away by anyone else according to the opposition parties however it is all one big con trick as always they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which they claim would ensure tax increases after the election he did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax as liberal democrat leader charles kennedy claimed for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless tory leader michael howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use he branded it a dodgy vote now pay later budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave britain the dodgy dossier where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown forecasts to the prime minister forecasts on iraq weapons of mass destruction as ever there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor red book which sets out the fine detail of his budget in an attempt to spot the flaws in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election

sport	henson stakes early lions claimthe six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson he very confident you just had to listen to his interview afterwards he beamed with confidence but although there an element of arrogance it good arrogance he certainly showed some nice touches he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand and that without even mentioning his majestic match winning penalty but i think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test he needs to come up against brian odriscoll or a big french midfield wales fly half stephen jones was another player who impressed me he gave good direction he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side he showed he can control a game with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number shirt could be up for grabs and jones or maybe even henson could make the lions team at fly half jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday game some of the wales forwards surprised me because i thought they would be out muscled in the tight five england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top however i still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame some english players did their cause no harm i thought joe worsley had a solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and i think it will be a while before we see him again despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france tom smith has been there and done it before but the likes of chris cusiter jason white and ally hogg all made their mark hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game his defence is right up there cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward the star of ireland win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand brian odriscoll is a class act he ran some good lines against italy made the breaks and fed his outside backs although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him gordon darcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson darcy odriscoll combination in the lions midfield paul oconnell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and malcolm okelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up while shane byrne seems to be a lively character but they will be a bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday although i used to play in italy and i know how difficult it can be one player who did impress me was wales scrum half dwayne peel he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing they had good possession and he kicked the ball away i would want him as my lions scrum half after that
sport	murphy that was a bruising battlethat what i call a tough game it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory their organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it im not too bad but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning in the backs we were not frustrated at such but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half it always good to score it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee eddie osullivan was very calm at half time even though we were only ahead he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half we were penalised a lot at the breakdown and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries but it does not that good now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover it a big ask after such a bruising encounter i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us in the meantime when in rome

sport	a year to remember for irishthere used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most well at least there used to one now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction and sorrow it has been quite a year for the irish and not just with eddie osullivan triple crown winning international outfit either right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game but most of the kudos will go to osullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for years but also finished their autumn campaign with a record for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners up spot in the rbs six nations but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa ireland finsihed the year on a high the victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer those two reverses and the flop against france were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent months but the big one of course was the defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf the winning try was conceived in osullivan mind perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey for me the try of the championship osullivan career is now in vertical take off mode it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway based coach to head the lions test side not only that but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand there can be no doubt that ireland representation will be the biggest ever albeit in a proposed man squad in brian odriscoll and paul oconnell ireland have now the two front runners for the captaincy gordon darcy whose career began as a teenager back in finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well the under squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners up to england in the six nations under tournament on the provincial front leinster for second year in succession blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager while ulster finished runners up in their very tight group for the second season in succession it was munster again flying the flag for the irish looking to reach their third final they went down to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road how wasps recovered from that energy sapping duel and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody guess ulster meanwhile just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game ulster however took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first outings in the celtic league leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing on the down side irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under world cup game in durban that happened only days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools cup success since the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in the last time that goal had been achieved before this season ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well known londonderry ym player jim huey coleraine jonathan hutchinson and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole they all passed away long before the full time whistle

zealand first game nelson town met nelson college on may the town triumphing by two goals to nil instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country sporting passions the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport warrior ethos in a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team twenty two maori and four pakiha formed the new zealand native team who played a total of matches in new zealand australia and the uk the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre match tradition of the maori war dance the haka ! the other great symbol of new zealand rugby the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in new zealand played their first international against australia in the kiwis triumphing in sydney and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain david revell bedell sivright created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a triumph in wellington sparking great celebrations across the country but bedell sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk their opportunity to prove him wrong came in with the first official new zealand tour to europe the tourists won their early games with a quick thinking inventive approach but press criticism began to grow over their scrum formation that left a roving forward free to disrupt opposition attacks the tactic was effective two late tries seeing the kiwis to a win over scotland before ireland were despatched in dublin a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a hammering of england new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first golden age and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a win in a hard fought encounter at cardiff arms park but post match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas dallas said that deans was tackled short but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try on his death bed three years later he exclaimed i did score that try in cardiff four of the all blacks went over to the newly formed all golds rugby league side soon after the tour but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo welsh touring team in the first south africa tour of new zealand in saw honours shared in a three test series starting the greatest rivalry in rugby and the long running controversy between the countries over the all blacks inclusion of maori players the awesome all black tourists became known as the invincibles after winning all of their games in france britain and ireland including a crushing victory over wales at st helen despite their success the all blacks scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in employing the modern scrum line up against the new zealand rover system for the first time south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two all the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the lions tour a series won by new zealand the lions manager describing the tactic as cheating prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum the all blacks european tour started inauspiciously with an loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage schoolboy half backs hayden tanner and willie davies a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales although the winning try from geoffrey rees jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build up new zealand next visit to wales in proved difficult as they lost to cardiff and drew at swansea the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park but the teams were locked at when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous match winning try the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations before a success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller new zealand built from that tour and by the time they returned in they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely win over the tourists at rodney parade wilson whinneray side rallied to beat wales their first win at the arms park in four attempts and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour but when they returned home the first question put to them was what happened in newport the only blemish on the record of the awesome tourists was a draw with east wales as they beat the full wales team in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team a ferocious game at the arms park in was edged by the all blacks a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james inspired lions of james guided llanelli to a famous win over the tourists at stradey park though and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played new zealand defeated a wales xv at the arms park in a non cap game in but it was the game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries wales were leading with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line out television pictures clearly showed that he dived but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty duly converted by brian mckechnie for a win since that infamous game the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game a crushing win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union centenary game was a sign of things to come the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside in brisbane in the semi final of the inaugural world cup the kiwis went on to claim the cup and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill fated tour of new zealand a young talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them and after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game but as his views were ignored he along with a generation of wales best players chose to head north to rugby league a win in cardiff followed for new zealand in and at the world cup wales big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg a crushing kiwi triumph in wembley followed in and as wales misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff new millennium stadium in they left with a victory a bruising defeat followed for wales in hamilton in as hansen built towards the world cup but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope wales were given no chance going into the game but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead early in the second half new zealand rallied to a win but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over years they have a chance but clearly history is

sport	dallaglio his own man to the endcontroversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career even the end of his nine year career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of a sustained period of success for england dallaglio crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back row positions at international standard within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captain band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team mate martin johnson he played a massive role in the series victory but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglio career hit the buffers at speed in first came the last minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson as a member of a new look england side on the long road to world cup glory a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again yet another setback arrived in as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglio involvement on the lions tour to australia rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre the only player to play every minute of england world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnson retirement dallaglio career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio second spell as captain losing five of their eight post world cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio role as captain but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the year old although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no stand out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio massive influence on english rugby

tech	bond game fails to shake or stirfor gaming fans the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of but also the classic shoot em up that accompanied it and left n owners glued to their consoles for many an hour adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original massive sense of fun this however is not a sequel nor does it relate to the goldeneye film you are the eponymous renegade spy an agent who deserts to the bond world extensive ranks of criminal masterminds after being deemed too brutal for mi your new commander in chief is the portly auric goldfinger last seen in but happily running around bent on world domination with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner similarly titled theme song the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury which enables a degree of x ray vision rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments squashed by a plummeting helicopter the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a game but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise this title lacks that aura and when the bond magic shines through it feels like a lucky accident the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination admittedly the competition has been tough even in recent weeks with the likes of halo and half life triumphing in virtually every department what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy dynamic scenes of violent chaos as is the trend of late you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos meaning that frustration is often the outcome and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed a minute red dot passes for a crosshair although the collision detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky and you will not always know you have picked them off since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights no time is risked with a measured build up by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hat fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion there is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains and it is a testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such a dash but the in game niggles combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought through will make this a disappointment for most diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings the game is weak not completely unplayable then again fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras given james bond healthy pedigree in past games there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip a commendable idea that just has not worked that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return goldeneye rogue agent is out now

tech	broadband soars in broadband were a jumbo jet then would have seen it taxiing down the runway firing up its engines and preparing for take off but this year has seen it soar in the spring it literally took to the skies as lufthansa and british airways trialled it on flights this perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology rather than how useful sky high broadband would actually be it was flying high and by the autumn five million britons had signed up for high speed net access at home such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million or more than of homes the two key factors in whetting people appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard broadband for less than at the beginning of the year it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached broadband had truly gone mass market a feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take up of dial up broadband for less than was even touted by some firms although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models for those who became broadbanders in there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities the rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access to the tune of million connections worldwide by april prompting research firm point topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever by september the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every seconds broadband was being mentioned on the oclock news and in the tabloids the sun even carried a cartoon joke about it but two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines in may bt quietly announced that it was shaving off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges so called local loop unbundling the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes at the moment bt has a stranglehold on more than of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what adsl products get into homes with cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise like it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to megabits per second and the major price fall means that rather than just talk about it companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt exchanges it may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the northern ireland peace talks fraught bitter and with no end in sight another big piece of news for broadband users in was the extension of bt reach meaning more than of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived there was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to broadband they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband enabled exchange for thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology the news meant they could finally join in broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year the biggest news for them was increased speeds introducing and services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route broadband can seem confusing for consumers with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set up fees it is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in but remains a plane worth catching as it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride

tech	blinx sequel purrs nicelythe original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft then new xbox console its sharp graphics and novel gameplay with the main character able to pause slow rewind and fast forward time were meant to lure many fans to the new machine but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half way through a level without the required tools to finish thankfully the sequel has fixed many of the original faults this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions pig and feline assuming the role of your created characters the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal as in the original your feline persona can control time but this time the pigs get to control space there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps space bubbles and void traps in order to progress the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr style icons and is quite intuitive annoyingly the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps and so there are a number of combat elements these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair but the game excellent graphics easily the best looking platform game around sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans blinx is out on xbox now

tech	rings of steel combat net attacksgambling is hugely popular especially with tech savvy criminals many extortionists are targeting net based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk biggest net firms to stop these attacks increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures net firms are realising that it not just about anti virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres mr king said the only way to properly combat these so called distributed denial of service attacks was with intelligent net based systems many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with megabytes of data over short periods of time bigger attacks sending down megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave however he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites it about understanding what genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi tech criminal that set off the virus hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e mail said ms capella we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up energis took a similar approach said mr seagrave we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target we have people in places where they should be monitoring tech sites he said sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave

tech	games help you learn and playgod games in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational says research a us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore said mr purushotma there must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework but instead of fearing computer games ravi purushotma believes that educationalists particularly language teachers should embrace games one goal would be to break what i believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional he said he believes that the phenomenal ability of games such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation the hard part of learning any language said mr purushotma were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity he said by contrast said mr purushotma learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all this was because the sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on the incidental information about what a sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning said mr purushotma by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context for instance he said in a version of the sims adapted to teach german if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word energie the actions of a tired sim stumbling then falling asleep would illustrate the meaning if necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players or students understanding one of the drawbacks of the sims said mr purushotma was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation however online versions of the sims in which people have to move in meet the neighbours and get to know the local town could be adapted to help this although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid he believes before now he said educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games but he said using pre prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons im hoping now to re create a well polished german learning mod for the sequel by this summer he told the bbc news website im encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with japanese and spanish earlier work with a colleague on using civilisation iii to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society problems can not always come from making a single change a report on the experiment said students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play using geography and history as tools for their game and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play mr purushotma ideas were aired in an article for the journal language learning and technology

tech	format wars could confuse userstechnology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research the difference is that it is very fragmented he said it not a two horse race it a five six seven or even eight horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families although initiatives such as microsoft plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come shelley taylor analyst and author of a report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers apple itunes service was a perfect example of this she said although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop people want portability she said and with peer to peer they have portability cory doctorow european co ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber rights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over consumers the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again the ipod version the auto version the american and uk version the ringtone version and so on
tech	peer to peer nets here to staypeer to peer p networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says a panel of industry experts once several high profile legal cases against file sharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from p technology the expert panel probed the future of p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january the first convictions for p piracy were handed out in the us in january william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software since the first successful file sharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy but that is going to change very soon according to the panel the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p networks which are not illegal in themselves and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks but they have slowly realised that p is a good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of p network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want a slice of it they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copy protection standards but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with p cannot not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said old media always tries to stop new media when they ca stop it they try to control it then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business in august the san francisco based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two file sharing networks the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files instead it uses direct connections between computers or clients there are now many different types of p systems than work in different ways p nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p technology to distribute them the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many the global entertainment industry says more than billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half a million films are downloaded a day legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file sharers away from free content sales of legally downloaded songs grew tenfold in with million tracks bought online in the us and europe in months the ifpi reported this week but such download services are very different from p networks not least because of the financial aspect there are several money spinning models that could turn p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies paid for pass along in which firms receive money each time a file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiser based options are all being considered we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p said marc morgenstern vice president of anti piracy firm overpeer consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry potential controlling grip on content and p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations unsigned bands for example use p networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign increasingly what you are seeing on p is consumer created content said derek broes from microsoft they will probably pay an increasing role in helping p spread he said looking into p future file sharing is just the beginning for p networks as far as mr broes is concerned once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said file sharing is the tip of the iceberg

tech	big war games battle it outthe arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats building on many of the original elements for its part the long running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue adapting the console game rising sun call of duty finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war battlefronts including russia and north africa it is a traditional first person viewed game that lets you control just one character in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you on a near identical note medal of honor pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight knit team and plum in the middle of all out action its arenas are the war pacific battles including guadalcanal and pearl harbour you play one character throughout a raw and rather talkative us soldier both games rely on a carefully stage managed structure that keeps things ticking along when this works it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story when it does not it is tedious a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman before seizing the anti aircraft guns it is one of the finest set pieces ever seen in a video game this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre determined path forcibly witnessing a series of pre set moments of action is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic the genius of something like half life is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection this pair of games do not really accomplish that being more concerned with imparting a full on atmospheric experience call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation finest hour has a similar determination framing everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lots of reflective voice overs letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat the game drawback could be said to be its format tastes differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc the mouse control is a big reason why along with the sharper graphics a top end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety call of duty on pc was more detailed plot wise and graphically and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready targeting with the ps controller proved tricky not helped by unconvincing collision detection you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot which happens regularly you are set harshly far back and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again the game wants to be a challenge and is and many players will like it for that it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour and in pacific assault in particular their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all of the two games pacific assault gets more things right including little points like auto saving intelligently and having tidier presentation it engages you very well and also looks wonderful making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry although we had to ramp up the settings on a high spec machine to get the most out of them finest hour is by no means bad and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent

tech	file swappers ready new networklegal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down one site behind the success of the bittorrent file swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised that file sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to now the man behind suprnova org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new file swapping network dubbed exeem in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file sharing systems like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone there will be no centrally maintained list this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users an early public version of the software should be available before february sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development there were no plans for a linux or mac version he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program despite suprnova administrator sloncek involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer to peer networks said exeem was the next evolution in file sharing systems but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared exeem cannot prevent pollution he said the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that full of crap like kazaa he said there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said mr pouwelse said that future versions of file sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic it hard to compete with free he said no one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file sharing development

tech	rings of steel combat net attacksgambling is hugely popular especially with tech savvy criminals many extortionists are targeting net based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk biggest net firms to stop these attacks increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures net firms are realising that it not just about anti virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres mr king said the only way to properly combat these so called distributed denial of service attacks was with intelligent net based systems many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with megabytes of data over short periods of time bigger attacks sending down megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave however he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites it about understanding what genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi tech criminal that set off the virus hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e mail said ms capella we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up energis took a similar approach said mr seagrave we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target we have people in places where they should be monitoring tech sites he said sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave
tech	apple mac mini gets warm welcomethe mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans industry experts and pc users the release of the tiny low cost machine is seen as a good move for apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy to use and administer second home computer it the bravest move they have made yet said jonny evans news editor at macworld magazine mr evans said the combination of low cost small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware it deeply affordable he said plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems already he said pc owning friends had declared that they would be buying one interest in the new products launched at macworld expo was so strong that websites for apple store and the show struggled to cope with demand according to response statistics gathered by netcraft many visiting the apple store in the wake of mr jobs speech suffered lengthy response times the macworld expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline i think fundamentally it a good idea because it cheap even for a pc said nick ross deputy labs editor at pc pro apple work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans he said i think people expect it just to work now and really it should hesaid the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer he said for browsing the web e mail and all kinds of basic duties it going to be absolutely adequate said mr ross ian fogg broadband and personal technology analyst at jupiter research agreed that the mac mini could be very popular apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac he said before now he said apple has been seen as a premium brand but he said the mac mini changed that perception it a particularly good price when you see that it apple that is doing it he said apple expects the mac mini to sell for in the uk and in the us adding extras such as a larger hard drive more memory and networking options will increase the basic price it will go on sale from january for consumers interested in style design and small size which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in it a natural next step said mr fogg apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at said mr fogg who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction his only misgivings were over how easy other consumers other than ipod owners would find using the machine he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor they be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost he said those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine there are also questions over whether the mac mini will work with very old peripherals such as display keyboard and mouse the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music movies and images people accumulate said mr fogg the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet he said it does not have the right connectors that fit a tv screen or enough storage said mr fogg it very much a computer one dissenting opinion came from brian gammage vice president of research at analysts gartner he said i do think it changes the world although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer it was still expensive compared to many pcs also he said it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying a home computer the pc world is a pile em high sell em cheap market he said and all of them are pretty interchangeable since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long slow decline he said every few years it does something to give its market share a kick then it starts to go back down again said mr gammage the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend he said

can you get more for your money if you stick with the beige box an extremely small computer that is designed to bring the macintosh to the masses apple offer a less powerful mac mini for but the models has a power pc chip gigabyte hard drive combined cd burner dvd player it comes equipped with usb and firewire ports for peripheral connections ethernet port for broadband a port for standard video output and an audio headphone jack the machine comes with mac os x the apple operating system the software suite ilife which includes itunes iphoto imovie idvd and garageband a monitor keyboard or mouse there is also no built in support for wireless technology or any speakers the lack of a dvd burner is an omission in the age of backing up important software wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost apple are targeting people who already have a main computer and want to upgrade especially pc users who have used an apple ipod compact and stylish the mac mini would not look out of place in any home apple computers are famously user friendly and offer much better network security which means fewer viruses the package of software that comes with the machine is the best money can buy the mac mini is just a box if you do already have a monitor etc adding them to the package sees the value for money begin to dwindle macs do offer the upgrade flexibility of a pc and the machine specifications lack the horse power for tasks such as high end video editing or games the mac mini puts the macintosh within the reach of everyone an apple spokesman said it will bring more customers to the platform especially pc users and owners an entry level machine designed for basic home use a intel celeron chip gigabyte hard drive combined cd burner dvd player it comes equipped with a inch monitor keyboard and mouse the machine has usb ports and an ethernet port for broadband connection there also a port for standard video output the machine comes with windows xp home edition it provides basic home tools such as a media player and word processor a dvd burner or any wireless components built in wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost homes and small offices including those looking to add a low cost second computer cost is the clear advantage the dell provides enough power and software for basic gaming and internet surfing it easily upgradeable so a bigger hard drive better sound and graphics cards can be added the dell is hardly stylish and the hard drive is on the small size for anyone wanting to store photos or a decent sized digital music collection this machine is for small businesses and for people who want a second computer for basic home use perhaps in a kids bedroom a spokesman for dell said i think we offer better value once you realise all the extras needed for the mac mini a desktop computer that pc pro magazine dubbed best performer in a group test of machines that cost only including vat a good basic pc that according to pc pro has superb upgrade potential for your money you get a amd sempron processor of ram hard drive dvd writer inch monitor mouse keyboard and windows xp more than the basics it cannot handle graphics and has no firewire slots those on a limited budget who want a machine they can add to and improve as their cash allows it cheap and has plenty of room to improve but that could end up making it expensive in the long run it a good basic workhorse it not pretty and has a monitor rather than a flat panel display some of the upgrades offered by jal to the basic model are pricey you might find that you want to chop and change quite quickly nick ross deputy labs editor at pc pro said the important point about buying a cheap and cheerful pc is the upgrade path interest has switched from processor power to graphics and sound cards as that what makes the difference in games even manufacturers are not going to be marketing machines as faster he said they emphasise the different features a computer built from bits you buy and put together yourself a surprisingly good pc sporting an amd athlon xp processor megabytes ram a graphics card with ram on board plus tv out a gb hard drive cd writer and dvd player windows xp home anything else you building it so you have to buy all the software you want to install and do your own trouble shooting and tech support building your own machine is easier than it used to be but you need to read specifications carefully to make sure all parts work together experienced and keen pc users building your own pc or upgrading the one you have is a great way to improve your understanding of how it all works it cheap you can specify exactly what you want and you get the thrill of putting it together yourself and a bigger thrill if everything works as it should once it built you wo be able to do much with it until you start buying software for it if it starts to go wrong it might take a lot of fixing as gavin cox of the excellent buildyourown org uk website put it it will be tough to obtain build a pc to ever be as compact and charming as the mac mini performance wise it not cutting edge and is barely entry level by today

tech	format wars could confuse userstechnology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research the difference is that it is very fragmented he said it not a two horse race it a five six seven or even eight horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families although initiatives such as microsoft plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come shelley taylor analyst and author of a report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers apple itunes service was a perfect example of this she said although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop people want portability she said and with peer to peer they have portability cory doctorow european co ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber rights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over consumers the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again the ipod version the auto version the american and uk version the ringtone version and so on
tech	mobiles get set for visual radiothe growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked games cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years but could see another big innovation that wo just see a change in our mobile phone habits it might alter the way we listen to the radio finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius a senior project manager at nokia was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium he said im very happy to say it not television what we talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today if you have a visual radio enabled handset when you hear an artist you do know or there a competition or vote that you like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on air broadcast you just been listening to that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in a similar way to digital television red button content possible interactive content includes competitions votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real time basis this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network and there will be a cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it be two or three pounds per month said mr wasenius but typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial up connections one thing that is for sure assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets it is estimating that there will be million visual radio enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of basically visual radio is not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners station manager steve taylor commented listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like mp music downloads and the latest gig tickets initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon the and but if successful it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them listen again to the interview on the radio five live website
tech	gamers could drive high definitiontv films and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens it is called high definition hd for short and it is already hugely popular in japan and the us it is set according to analysts to do for images what cds did for sound different equipment able to receive hd signals is needed though and is expensive but europe gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand europeans will have to wait until at least until they see mainstream hdtv to view it it needs to be transmitted in hd format and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high quality resolution the next generation of consoles however are expected to start appearing at the end of start of and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high resolution pictures in the next generation of consoles hd support is mandatory dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website every game is going to be playable in hd so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs and who have no content to watch are going to be blown away by these really high detail pictures it going to change really the way they look at gaming at the end of last year chris deering sony european president made a prediction that million european households would have hdtv sets by a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at million by an increase from an estimated sets at the end of but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology about if there are few programmes or films to watch on them satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by until broadcast rights format standards and the practicalities of updating equipment are agreed tv content will be limited all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen and scan lines which go down the screen most standard uk tv pictures are made up of lines and about pixels hd offers up to active lines with each line made up of pixels this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv probably in the uk gaming is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off as in look what this tv can do until hd is really adopted by broadcasters explains dr tuffy but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics and more immersive gaming experiences they are used to spending money on hardware to match a game requirements demographics have changed too and the sweet spot for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big screen high definition display technologies and hd projectors earlier than others higher capacity storage discs such as hd dvd and blue ray are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles allowing developers more room for detailed graphics for console developers though hd offers some production changes it could make games production slightly more expensive thinks dr tuffy but we may see the cross platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a pc game and apply it to a console he says you are literally going to get to the point with a lord of the rings game for example is going to be closer and closer to the actual film especially the cgi stuff from the dvd and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game just now they have almost got it seamless with hd he says the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big screen cinema release this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide at that point says dr tuffy games could become more or less interactive movies
tech	how to make a greener computerthe hi tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware bill thompson thinks it about time my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge now you ca buy petrol with lead additives and we all better off as a result chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic mercury cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops mobiles and music players one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive a well designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears it is as they say about time we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage the car engine is a case in point lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder a phenomenon called knocking so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work so it took decades before it was done we seeing the same thing in the technology industry and as a result there are billions of devices from old mobile phones to antique handhelds that will have to be recycled in years to come if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc keeping the monitor and other peripherals even if apple does not get its way four or five year old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it not unreasonable to replace them but what do we do with the old onesi just looked around my office and i find two monitors an old pc two old handhelds three ancient laptops four antique mobile phones a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use they are all old enough to be hazardous waste the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead but it possible that some of the components could be useful i could take them up the to the council recycling centre but it a mile drive away across town and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste a box for glass cans and paper that can be recycled and a black bin for the rest there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too i probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box at least eventually bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

tech	mobile games come of agethe bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing a brief round up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below part two will follow on monday reviews of call of duty splinter cell pandora tomorrow lord of the rings and pocket kingdom will follow on monday if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time even before nokia n gage game phone launched in late many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles there are shoot em ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie in increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available even the ones that use graphics the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth short range radio technology with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing too fast too furious digital bridgesas soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving

various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth graphics are a bit cartoon like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring both background music and sounds effects work well the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while with the right power up you can go into a matrix style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps
tech	web radio takes spanish rap globalspin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish language music but what you will not find is much spanish language hip hop hip hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish speaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad but now a us company is bringing rap and hip hop en espanol to computer users everywhere los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico hottest hip hop acts they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey but most mexican hip hop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanish speaking world rarely get a chance to hear the group tracks on the radio you ca really just go on the radio and listen to hip hop in spanish it just not accessible says manuel millan a native of san diego california it really hard for the spanish hip hop scene to get into mainstream radio you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world millan and two friends set out to change that they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible so millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio com the name says it all it is web based radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip hop tracks the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate all the user has to do is download a media player there are no djs it is just music streamed over the net for free suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan g are producing export quality rap the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip hop right now the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage but the production values are improving and artists such as argentina mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio com he considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hip hop scene millan says he really has had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but he definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish speaking world currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio com top as is cuban artist papo record every country got it own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says latinohiphopradio com has been up and running for a couple of months now the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world right now mexico leads the way accounting for about of listeners but web surfers in spain are logging in as well about of the web station traffic comes from there that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish language rap and hip hop millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip hop production that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio com top his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip hop leader in spain on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact it basically him bragging that he one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says and it pretty much true he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable it amazing latinohiphopradio com is hoping to expand in the coming year millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip hop and rap clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production
tech	what high definition will do to dvdsfirst it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment high definition high definition gives incredible like pictures and surround sound the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out but when high definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high definition future is an exciting prospect he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high def world and i find it very exciting high definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition dvds in months time mr dean is confident though i think if they see real hd high definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen high definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too on the whole producing films for high definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about gigabits per second says mr dean our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second that a huge amount of compression that has to be applied about so if you have anything that allows more space you do have to compress so hard studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high capacity dvds currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean although the step of down converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day work says mr dean one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took human hours alone if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high definition dvd but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean high definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i everybody was very sun tanned but that was make up in the hd version of episode i all these make up lines showed up explains mr dean the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too there are scans of a corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just did see it what high definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband giving a dvd like experience from the set top box to the hard drive says mr dean but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves

tech	why cell will get the hard sellthe world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time but what is so important about it and why is it so differentthe backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry ibm is one of the largest and most respected chip makers in the world providing cutting edge technology to large businesses sony will be using the chip inside its playstation console and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms the technology inside the cell is being heralded as revolutionary from a technical standpoint traditional computers whether they are household pcs or playstation use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer the cell technology on the other hand uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously this gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors whilst its rivals are working on similar technology it is sony which is the most advanced the speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years but the memory technology that accompanies the cell is a huge leap in performance using a technology called xdr created by american firm rambus memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by intel perhaps more important than any of the technology is the cell role in the imminent war on living rooms the big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as dvd players and hi fis companies like microsoft and sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the tv of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place microsoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its windows media center software which has been adopted by many pc makers sony had a stab at something similar with the psx a variation on the playstation last year in japan although this attempt was generally seen as a failure both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles to make them as powerful as pcs will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack sony and ibm want to make sure that the dominance of the pc market enjoyed by microsoft and intel is not allowed to extend to this market by creating a radically new architecture and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room shutting out their rivals once they have established themselves under the tv there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional pcs and instigate a regime change on the desktop cell is in fact specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house the links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach cell processors in entirely different systems sony hopes to put cells in televisions kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip each cell will be linked to the others creating a vast home network of computing power resources of the cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other so that you can programme your microwave from your tv for example this digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there are as with all things a number of reasons it could fail because the processor is so different it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master you can also guarantee that microsoft and intel are not going to sit around and let cell take over home computing without a fight microsoft is going to be pushing its xbox as hard as possible to make sure that its technology not sony will be under your tree next christmas intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to cell so that it does lose its desktop pc dominance if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice however it could provide the jump start to the fully digital home of the future the revolution might not be televised but it could well be played with a videogame controller

tech	britons fed up with net servicea survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service they are fed up with slow speeds high prices and the level of customer service they receive of readers have switched suppliers and a further are considering changing in the near future it is particularly bad news for bt the uk biggest internet supplier with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining a third of the broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton editor of pc pro magazine we expect these figures to leap in every month the prices drop and more and more people are trying to switch he said the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription some readers were offered a price drop just more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator making it hardly worth while swapping other found themselves tied into month contracts broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all we discovered a huge variety of problems but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier said tim danton editor of pc pro this breaks the code of practice but because that code is voluntary there nothing we or ofcom can do to help he said there is a vast choice of internet service providers in the uk now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages with prices set to drop even further in coming months mr danton advises everyone to shop around carefully if you just stick with your current connection then there every chance you being ripped off he warned
tech	intel unveils laser breakthroughintel has said it has found a way to put a silicon based laser on a chip raising hopes of much faster networks scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade we overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high volume manufacturing have been solved we trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy to make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semi conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses it a technical validation that it can work he said
tech	eu software patent law faces axethe european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re drafted or even scrapped the bill was backed by some hi tech firms saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile hugo lueders european director for public policy at comptia an umbrella organization for technology companies said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement the proposed law had a troubled passage through the european parliament its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee juri said the law should be re drafted after it failed to win the support of meps to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill the latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the eu for re consideration

tech	mac mini heralds mini revolutionthe mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month but does the latest macintosh justify the hype let us get a few things dealt with at the outset yes the mac mini is really really small and yes it is another piece of inspired apple design there is more to be said on the computer size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer inside that small box there is a g processor a cd dvd player a hard drive some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system a dvd burner wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost and if you do not have a monitor keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications apple software the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x the operating system as well as ilife a suite of software which includes itunes web browser safari iphoto garage band and idvd i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x of course users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs for people who want to do interesting things with their music photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer it a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses said mark sparrow technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine he added in essence it a laptop in a biscuit tin minus the screen and the keyboard the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically savvy to experiment with their macs one user has already created a dock to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in car entertainment playing movies and music as well as navigation another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes music films and photos partly due to its small living room friendly design but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case at least not in the here and now the hard drive at for the larger model is too small to be realistically used as media centre while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content a media centre computer has to store music files and photos and as such just seems too small most pcs running windows media center have at least hard disks coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is not what it is not but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses so is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing graham barlow editor of mac format understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint it just a mac but we should be very excited it revolutionary in its size smaller than pcs looks looks better than pcs and the fact that it the first mac designed to really go for the low cost pc market the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland bulky boxes there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini itx motherboards but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home build enthusiast or expensive pre built options based around microsoft media center software but for the value the mac mini offers bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before apple is to be congratulated let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution it is a mini revolution

tech	no re draft for eu patent lawa proposed european law on software patents will not be re drafted by the european commission ec despite requests by meps the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review all aspects of the directive the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention in a letter ec president jos manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament josep borrell that the commission did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council of ministers as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament request it would be an insult to the assembly he said that the parliament would then reject the council version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted this means that the us based amazon com holds a patent for its one click shopping service for example critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us

tech	have hackers recruited your pcmore than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses the huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than networks of remotely controlled machines the largest network of so called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of hijacked home computers data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them the detailed look at zombie or bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as honey pots to attract hackers and gather information about how they work while bot nets have been known about for some time estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely to gather its information the german arm of the honeynet project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy the longest time a honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes the shortest compromise time was only a few seconds the research found that once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on irc servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine many well known vulnerabilities in the windows operating system were exploited by bot net controllers to find and take over target machines especially coveted were home pcs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off the months of surveillance revealed that the different bot nets which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines are used for a variety of purposes many are used as relays for spam to route unwanted adverts to pc users or as launch platforms for viruses but the research team found that many are put to very different uses during the monitoring period the team saw bot nets used to launch distributed denial of service attacks on separate targets these attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target using a bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against one ddos attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline other bot nets were used to abuse the google adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games criminals also seem to be starting to use bot nets for mass identity theft to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data leveraging the power of several thousand bots it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly said the researchers even in unskilled hands it should be obvious that bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon
tech	what price for trusted pc securityyou can now buy trusted computers but can we really trust the pc vendors asks technology analyst bill thompson if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer a dell optiplex or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba hp compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module tpm that can be used for a range of hardware based security features eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children toys but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them and as part of a well designed network system it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware based at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure it might be password protected user accounts data encryption programs or a firewall but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor hardware security is less common even if it is a lot safer this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password but also because its more work for users systems administrators and managers as a result we settle for second best so when it comes to computer security trusted systems could be a major step forward after all if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems instead you have to use special software like hp protecttools or wave systems embassy this provides file encryption password management and identity protection usually for business users who connect to company networks full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows longhorn this will include what microsoft in a typical act of obscurantism calls the next generation secure computing base and it will give user level programs access to the trusted computing hardware when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall however there is a downside to the increased security from viruses spyware and data theft that this will provide because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management drm systems more secure this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music movies and books that we have bought from them we have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences users of apple itunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itunes users a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection but the latest version of itunes limits this capability just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a cd another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from real harmony service on your ipod apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law similarly users of tivo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day this happens because of changes that tivo have made to their software and the users cannot control it one wonders whether hardware based drm will work for those who believe that locking down digital content is a bad idea and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away it will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked once it is unlocked then someone somewhere will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version and once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable the efforts going into drm would be much better spent building efficient distribution services finding business models that are based on trusting your customers and offering high quality downloads at fair prices what we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform the record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us most of the time will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material they will benefit more by building a market in which i can share songs with my friends record shows i want to watch later and burn cds for my kids a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements we need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

tech	confusion over high definition tvnow that a critical mass of people have embraced digital tv dvds and digital video recorders the next revolution for tv is being prepared for our sets in most corners of tv and technology industries high definition hdtv is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour hd essentially makes tv picture quality at least four times better than now but there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about hd on the high street thousands of flat panel screens lcds liquid crystal displays plasma screens and dlp rear projection tv sets have already been sold as hd but are in fact not able to display hd the uk is the largest display market in europe according to john binks director of gfk which monitors global consumer markets but he added of all the flat panel screens sold just in the uk are capable of getting high definition there are different devices that are being sold as hd but are not hd ready according to alexander oudendijk senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant astra they may be fantastic quality tvs but many do not have adaptors in them called dvi or hdmi high definition multimedia interface connectors which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the high street say industry experts who gathered at bafta in london for the european hdtv summit last week we have to be careful about consumer confusion there is a massive education process to go through said mr binks the industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it eventually that will be everyone the bbc is currently developing plans to produce all its tv output to meet hdtv standards by preparations for the analogue switch off are already underway in some areas and programmes are being filmed with hd cameras bskyb plans to ship its first generation set top boxes to receive hdtv broadcasts in time for christmas like its sky boxes they will also be personal video recorders pvrs the company will start broadcasts of hdtv programmes offering them as premium channel packages concentrating to start with on sports big events and films in early but the set top box which receives hdtv broadcasts has to plug into a display tv set that can show the images at the much higher resolution that hd demands if hdtv is to be real by of homes in the uk will have some sort of tv set or display that can show hd in its full glory but it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to being digital as a result all the key players those who make flat panel displays as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters formed a hd forum in to make sure they were all talking to each other part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection but it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for from next month all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a hd ready sticker this also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and hdtv signals and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry the logo is absolutely the way forward said david mercer analysts with strategy analytics but it is still not appearing on many retail products the industry is upbeat that the sticker will help but it is only a start we can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers said mr oudendijk there may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months the european broadcast union ebu is testing different flavours of hd formats to prepare for even better hdtv further down the line it is similarly concerned that people get the right information on hdtv formats as well as which devices will support the formats we believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile said phil laven technical director for the ebu the tv display manufacturers want us to watch hd on screens that are at least to get the true impact of hd they say although smaller displays suffice what may convince people to spend money on hd ready devices is the falling prices which continue to tumble across europe the prices are dropping an average of every year according to analysts lcd prices dropped by in europe as a whole last year according to mr oudendijk
