entertainment	roundabout continues nostalgia tripthe new big screen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn children television into box office gold recent years have seen a less than successful adaptation of the puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit five children and it previously filmed by the bbc in he man and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the will soon receive their own costly makeovers with screen versions of the a team the dukes of hazzard and even blake seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung ! in the us replaces the stop motion models of the tv show with polished computer generated animation in a similar fashion the thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original puppets and models the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the now defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash this cg animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the stop motion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site and the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry anderson thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic children tv shows have a built in audience that make them ideal for reinvention i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today but i think it backfiring what next the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global box office performance the film cost but only recouped the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment after the success of garfield the movie britain shabby tabbysurely deserves his own film vehicle with only episodes made of the series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ furry recyclershave already had one big screen outing wombling free but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc supernatural comedy and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv most popular cartoon buccaneer it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed the magic roundabout is out in the uk on february how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his money ! thundercats ! ! i loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in ! it will bring my youth back ! get your hands off the clangers ! is nothing sacredmake a movie version of the banana splits ! what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse ! but then again it could be better than the original series could itit always nice to see these old toons re released but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song ! i think i been completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memories i think remakes are a good idea as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally i like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and m a s k get full hollywood remakes leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson love to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least a rating part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that ! films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place i have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film it got all the right material for an american blockbuster no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two it all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are film makers running out of original ideasall i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever i recently re watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation this time computer created flat cell like animation failed to match the original cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate we live in a sampling world the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now it just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new it got to be mr benn the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing ! if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character muffin the mule perhaps after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know ! why ca the british film industry try making gerry anderson ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people in today media it seems the past is the future tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes dj are sampling or re working and music even computer games from years ago are getting modern re workings personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more ! why not just leave our misty eyed nostalgia alone mary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i was even there ! i like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today film makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern children book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the pastmr benn with rowan atkinson as the lead would have loved to see dungeons dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into did come up to scratch the only one that is to be remade as yet is thundercats which i like to see im an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children programs for my daughters my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen ! ! very scandinavian rainbow ! i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because it original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bod oh the list could go on and on ! ! ! if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then i be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price ! i do care ! till then i have to make do with the citreon c advert i luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb children programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch hmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at im showing my age noggin the nog was one of the best children programs the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no one could approach oliver postgate wonderful voices so in general leave well alone the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life like fingermousebob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe car of course gerry anderson supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big screen big budget action it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a childre movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves it only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods is it i hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation i love that one in a shed clunkiness and you could recreate the magic perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mock authentic style i might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega ! this re gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people ideas because it guarantees to bring in the the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short term the fact that they will be forgotten in months time is irrelevant e g starsky hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it ! i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies im only and do remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and it a classic the fact it so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today stuff it looks amateurish thats the appeal though it so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it

entertainment	us afflicted with awards fatiguethe film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinema goers and the tv viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies according to some la film critics bob strauss from the la daily news thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events which roughly translates a celebrity love in this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them calling award shows idiotic as chris rock accurately said they about celebrity and fashion mr strauss said the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner unsurprisingly this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue but entertainment weekly dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster such as titanic or lord of the rings was nominated the near constant flow of us film awards representing directors actors and producers guilds also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us he said a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt on thursday the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry related news while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to win screen international us editor mike goodridge thinks films have simply not grabbed the public imagination film makers have produced films that people adore this year he said they adored saving private ryan for example people loved it and it made a ton of money films could be a reaction to there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all audiences do necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby aviator and finding neverland which end with casualty as to whether rock could pep up the awards the critics were not hopeful mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact but added im all for lower ratings though there are far more important things going on than the oscars mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers but mike goodridge thought rock humour could prompt america conservative states to switch off so despite all this did the critics have any views on who would win clint eastwood million dollar baby affected people emotionally which is why it will beat aviator which was about technical artistry not feelings mr karger said eastwood has it in the bag added mr strauss oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorsese aviator and million dollar baby mr karger whose favourite film of the year was mike leigh abortion drama vera drake stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments i hope this is the year for small films to triumph he said after all it still one of the biggest tv events of the year

politics	minimum wage increased to minimum wage will rise in october benefiting more than people the government has announced adults must be paid at least an hour up from while to year olds will be paid the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in businesses wanted it frozen warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a rate a further increase in the adult rate to an hour is provisionally scheduled for october according to the commission many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage challenging we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact said chairman adair turner the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women with many working in cleaning catering shops and hairdressing unveiling the latest increase mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a symbol of decency and fairness for too long poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard working families he said too often people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast the government has not accepted the commission recommendation that year olds should be paid at the adult rate but says it will look again at the rate later on mr brown said we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage the national minimum wage is currently set at per hour for those aged and above and at for those aged to a per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for to year olds but apprentices are exempt the trade unions congress welcomed the increase but has called for a minimum wage by next year but the confederation of british industry cbi called for a pause year to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october and david frost director of the british chambers of commerce said the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation what employers are saying to us now is that it at a level where it starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country the liberal democrats economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage it not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too he said conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increase speaking on bbc radio woman hour mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest paid workers there are people on very low salaries very low incomes indeed who really should be paying income tax he said it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below a year with say no tax on below the losses in tax can be recouped by having a tax band for people making over our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person is only of the us ! perhaps we have to really starting questioning why some products cost more here than they do in the us this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low paid people do make go much further it still not good enough ! i got a part time job at when i was doing my a levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni this was only years ago and i was getting paid an hour and working as hard as any of the older staff maybe it about time year olds got a fair wage ! we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together any increase is certainly welcome news however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them would you be happy to work for less than an hour thought not so then do expect others to either i ca believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage ! also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you it about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect would go a miss either br gt this is good news the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker relationship with their employer wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee efforts for too long wages were a point of exploitation what could an employer get away with in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low paid wages low with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat cat salaries bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr ! i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people ca afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses ! we all remember michael howard protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced funny how he gone quiet on that one ! jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in i think if any job is worth doing then it worth being paid a fair wage for and is hardly a fortune if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it not being run properly and if it folds a better run company will take over its duties and employ more people so everybody wins except incompetent business owners ! great keep at it tony i remember the despair of the and the low wages employers got away with at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working we ca afford not to pay a decent wage it not a jobs at any price economy goodbye sweatshops hello decency the increase in minimum wage is a good thing living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely like the rest of the country over the past years has made living for you average years old very difficult in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by an hour hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard but might never earn a figure salary the chance to branch out on our own i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services domestic catering portering etc pay the minimum wage of as the basic rate someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allowthis is definitely the right step in the right direction it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well this is a million votes more good strategy is italthough i would not deny people the minimum wage increase its timing stinks i am quite prepared for a raft of bribes to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards they are playing us for the fools they think we are this is extremely bad news for any business whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies by increasing overheads for business there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainers for next to nothing the extra cost this increase will bring will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy which in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting up business in the uk or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere the jubilation felt by low paid workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs this will only lead to a reduction in jobs why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india blair say the economy is strong and stable economy however consumer debt and the country debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses that will have no choice but to cut the workforce the timing cannot be coincidental this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is blatant electioneering i do mind if it is in our degraded democracy elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed if my maths is right a hour week at gives you an annual income just over and raising it to leaves it under the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as weat shop but now we are told it is global competition with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing the whole picture needs to be looked at this is great news but that might be because i work for minimum wage seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job when you can earn more from claiming than you can from work there is no incentive perhaps a step in the right direction if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close this will put more people out of work how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures ! the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us while im delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses as an employee for a small nursery i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october increase for the lower paid employees who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum this latest increase of an hour will cause even more financial hardship if the rate rises to then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff overtime being the first to go i currently employ staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery of my costs are labour the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businessesit is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobs i know about this great idea do bother getting qualifications laze about at school no need to do anything other than attend so your parents do get fined because remember when you do eventually start working does matter how lazy you are you be guaranteed a decent wage the ones who suffer are the employers i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury wo take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back doori do believe in the minimum wage at all ! i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them now before everyone thinks that i am some rich kid i can assure you i am not i came from a very much working class background and started work years ago on a youth opportunity program earning per week i worked hard went to college part time got my a levels and degree bettered myself i now earn a figure salary i did that through hard work and getting off my backside a minimum wage just makes people complacent to ashley of swindon when you earned per week it was worth something these days that would need to be near to to have the equivalent buying power i might add that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done years ago at equivalent wages in my day type arguments are a view that belong in the your day years ago ! as a graduate working for minimum wage i welcome any increase of pay i can get i disagree with ashley swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay i have my gcse a levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that ca afford the wages i should be getting i should be on at least what im getting but they ca afford it we all work hard but the money is just not there but on the plus side i love my job and would change it just to get more pay as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional per year these next rises will cost me more i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers so no one really wins in the end in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end on the contrary mr blair wins he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the mark there will be more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt namely mine think of us employers as well mr blair we are not all big corporations earning millions all workers should be entitled to a fair day pay for a fair day work how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirementit is good news for many asians living in uk students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country i thank mr blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage

politics	profile gordon brownthe ultimate prize of downing street may continue to elude him but as he prepares to deliver a record breaking ninth budget gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times he reached that milestone last june when he overtook david lloyd george who served for seven years and days between and how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election but for now mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors or politicians before him gordon brown was born in glasgow on february the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy at he was canvassing for labour and by his he was a leading political activist in scotland he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university where he went on to complete a phd his early career was spent lecturing working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party his first attempt to enter westminster for edinburgh south in was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs michael ancram but in he took dunfermline east a new constituency including rosyth naval base pit villages and coastal towns entering westminster he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield tony blair within four years mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury he became shadow chancellor under john smith leadership in after the death of leader john smith in he stood aside agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington the other part of the deal that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor is the stuff of westminster legend mr blair supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns and even a television film have been devoted to the alleged deal but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in mr brown continued his devotion to politics during the election campaign he is said to have worked an average of hours a day six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr brown former girlfriend of five years princess marguerite of romania the eldest daughter of ex king michael of romania who said a relationship with him was politics politics politics if that was true then mr brown who married pr executive sarah macaulay in changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary days after being born seven weeks prematurely a year later in october the couple had a son john an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side a trip to africa earlier this year to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession mr blair for his part is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute after a recent run of negative headlines labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering for the good of the party events like this and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues make it impossible to dismiss the brown blair feud as just journalistic hearsay cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question a truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown using the budget as a springboard is to revitalise labour campaign amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown including mr milburn but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can and mr blair decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for even if the prime minister intention to serve a

nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd the spanish captain gets involved as does the match

three set points but roddick saves them and then earns one himself nadal comes up with a down the line winner but then nets tamely on roddick next set point nadal nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points the point of the match so far involves roddick slam dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally on the very next point nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game nadal outplays roddick to reach but the american fights back to before nadal powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game the crowd are getting very involved cheering

simple love service game the first time he has held serve so far in the match if roddick did know before he knows now that he is in a real contest another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows four of the first five games have seen a break of serve despite the disappointment of losing his serve roddick is not phased and storms into a lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line call nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net roddick advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve nadal pumps his fist in celebration the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadal serve from the start nadal drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break after moya win in the opening rubber

tech	bad e mail habits sustains spamthe bad behaviour of e mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry a new study has found according to a survey conducted by security firm mirapoint and market research company the radicati group nearly a third of e mail users have clicked on links in spam messages one in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e mail accounts the fact that one in ten e mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little the report concludes this preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us said marcel nienhuis market analyst at the radicati group it explains why e mail security threats including spam viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate he said accusing users of bad e mail behaviour spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month according to security firm clearswift it has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney sony psp giveaways and in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the american drama series desperate housewives it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex but rather than finding a companion users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their pc clearswift has seen a rise in sex related spam over the course of the last month without casting aspersions those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that one thing leads to another but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems said alyn hockey clearswift director of research sexually explicit terms make up of security firm sophos top word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti spam filters spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by pass anti spam software said graham cluley senior technology consultant for security firm sophos the list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites money drugs and sex said mr cluley but anti spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e mail people must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails spammers are criminals plain and simple if no one responded to junk e mail and did buy products sold in this way then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs he said

tech	podcasters look to net moneynasa is doing it year old boys in bedrooms are doing it couples are doing it gadget lovers male and female are definitely doing it it is podcasting diy radio in the form of downloadable mp audio files they can done by anyone who has a microphone simple software the net and something to say some liken them to talking audioblogs because many complement text based weblogs diary like sites where people share their thoughts they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net on demand and the movement is at very early stages it about real people saying real things and communicating says adam curry former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting he was one of a community of people who created ipodder a small computer program known as an aggregator it collects and automatically sends mp files to any digital music playing device that can play wmp formats those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like and subscribe for free to that show feed when a new podcast is available it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer it is totally going to kill the business model of radio thinks curry i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are he says and they are scared to death of the next generation like my daughter who is who do listen to radio they are on msn they got their ipod their mp player they got their xbox they are not listening to radio so how are they going to reach these audiences it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it it is a fledgling movement but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it ian fogg jupiter research analyst thinks there could be potential for business but it could take an interesting turn if big companies like apple and microsoft get involved it is a nascent area but quite exciting it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over he says podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about a classic hybrid it is another aspect of the time shifting of content the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want when and wherever you want audiences are in the and rather than millions more than podcasts are currently listed curry daily source code which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community has of thousands of listeners but dave winer is doubtful he designed the format called rss really simple syndication which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed he is also writer of the longest running weblog on the net scripting news he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential not in its over hyped business promise we the sources the people doing stuff and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we doing no matter how you look at it commercialising this medium is going to make very much money he says podcasting is going to be a medium of niches with audiences measured in the single digits like e mail or blogs maybe in a few years maybe six or seven digits but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon curry and associate ron bloom new venture called podshow is to help ordinary people produce post distribute and market their podcasts because of the way podcasts work based on rss the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready made targets when you look at podcasting wow this is a pretty interesting audience the audience is pre selected they have decided to subscribe to your program explains curry advertising in his eyes can be tailored to podcasts to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive how i believe this will work is to create a network that in aggregation will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters i have listeners i could make a couple of bucks off that but not much if you are talking a million podcasters and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves then that is kind of interesting essentially he says if you are doing a bass fishing podcast someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show he is clear the ads will not be the traditional in your face type familiar to commercial radio now we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place it is happening already coffee loving curry has sold worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site others use in show promotions like the dawn and drew show one eric rice has won sponsorship from warner bros he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative one thing is for sure they are not about to disappear in a hurry the creative forces behind radio are elated says curry for now he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community i should be knighted for this he adds with a wry chuckle people are going to be so happy to sit at home make their podcast and make a little money

tech	rolling out next generation netthe body that oversees how the net works grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last years but it is just the start in a sense we have hardly started in reaching the whole population the new chair of the internet engineering task force ietf brian carpenter says the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net architecture with broadband take up growing services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net i think voip voice over internet protocol allowing phone calls to be made over the net is very important it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms says dr carpenter second it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure with voip you need very little infrastructure a distinguished ibm engineer dr carpenter spent years at cern the european laboratory for particle physics as the new chair of the ietf his next big challenge is overseeing ipv the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web at cern dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web so he is well placed to take on such a task the net growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work are open and free for anyone to use and work with the net is built on a protocol called tcp ip which means transmission control protocol and internet protocol when computers communicate with the net a unique ip address is used to send and receive information the ietf is a large international community of network designers operators vendors and researchers working on the evolution of the net architecture and the way this information is sent and received they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps we seen some interesting effects over last few years explains dr carpenter the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the then there was a bit of a glitch in we are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies like china which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies the number of broadband subscribers via dsl digital subscriber line doubled in a year to million according to figures released at the end of the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate explained dr carpenter given it the net was designed for the whole community it has done well to reach millions if you want to reach the whole population you have to make sure it can scale up ipv the standard that will replace the existing ipv will allow for billions more addresses on the net and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world the actual number of addresses with ipv is limited to four billion ip addresses that clearly is not enough when you have billion people to serve so there is technical solution the new version of ip ipv it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits said dr carpenter standards are vital to something as complex as the net and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task the difference this next generation standard ipv will make to the average net user is almost invisible our first goal is that it ipv should make no difference people should not notice a difference it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer a lot of the process will be invisible people are usually given an ip address without knowing it technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled said dr carpenter the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security to dr carpenter the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour people have to be educated about sensible behaviour he says such as ignoring e mails that claim you have won something i do think it is going to get worse people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards it is a never ending battle in a sense but he adds even if security has improved you still worry a bit unfortunately it is just part of life we have a duty to do what we can

tech	court mulls file sharing futurejudges at the us supreme court have been hearing evidence for and against file sharing networks the court will decide whether producers of file sharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement they questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue file sharers could deter innovation they also said that file trading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy the lawsuit brought by of the world largest entertainment firms has raged for several years legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file trading firms into bankruptcy but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus the file sharers at the centre of the case are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file sharing providers instead they would have to pursue individuals who use peer to peer networks to get their hands on free music and movies the hi tech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue intel filed a document with the supreme court earlier this month in defence of grokster and others despite misgivings about some aspects of the file sharing community it summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products are essentially tools that like any other tools capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes asking firms to second guess the uses that its technologies would be put to and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use would stifle innovation it said the electronic frontier foundation a civil rights watchdog is also defending streamcast networks the company behind the morpheus file sharing software the case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation it said it cites as do many the landmark ruling in which found that sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its betamax video recorder could be used for piracy defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peer to peer networks upholding the precedent set by the sony betamax case a small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered wearing save betamax t shirts the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past years said gary shapiro chief executive of the consumer electronics association supreme court justice stephen breyer said that inventions from printing to apple ipod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had on balance been beneficial to society he said that while file trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music conceptually the technology had some really excellent uses based on tuesday hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but file sharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy grokster lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up but this argument was dismissed as ridiculous by justice david souter cea boss mr shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the supreme court will hear this year it about preserving america proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumers to access and utilise technology he said the case has already been heard by two lower courts and both found in favour of the peer to peer networks they ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs file sharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software government documents and promotional copies of music

tech	apple laptop is greatest gadgetthe apple powerbook has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc the laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs the magazine has compiled an all time top list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the zenith remote control at two gadgets needed moving parts and or electronics to warrant inclusion the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a self contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded the oldest gadget in the top is the abacus which the magazine dates at a d and put in place other pre electronic gadgets in the top include the sextant from position the marine chronometer from position and the kodak brownie camera from position the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top which also includes the first flash mp player diamond multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv and mobile phone motorola startac the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number sony third entry in the top is the cdp cd player from who can forget the crystalline hiss free blast of madonna like a virgin emanating from their first cd player asked the magazine karl elsener knife the swiss army knife from is at number in the list gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone the nintendo gameboy and the pulsar quartz digital watch the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser toy tamagotchi and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler almost everyone has a mobile phone how many people own a powerbook or an ipod the findings of this magazine are not very convincing what about the magnetic compass we still use it years after it was invented i am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc flash mp portable cd players etc are really just improvements in technology my favourite true gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing i use to froth up my coffee ! calm down it only in their opinion and any list that includes the taser in the top gadgets has to be suspect swiss army knife and no question about it how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful popular you do need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out ! this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair whilst the americans focus on apple tv remotes and tivo which probably is rather obscure in europe what about the soda stream this gadget changed my pre teen life lap tops may enable you to think different but you cant use them to get busy with the fizzy how about astro wars one of the pioneers for computer games i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today ! however tried it the other day and it was rubbish still a great gadget of its time why worry about mobile phones soon they will be subsumed into the pda laptops etc what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries for it time a technological marvel ! sony net minidisc ! it paved the way for more mp player to explode onto the market i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it a laptop computer is not a gadget ! it a working tool ! the sinclair executive was the world first pocket calculator i think this should be there as well how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly has everyone forgot about the breville pie makeran interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early blessed the original noteboook pc the tandy the size of a paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible what an apple powerbook it out of date not much of a gadget surely it has to be something simple timeless the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off all top are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high tech obsession than anything else i say this as the swiss army knife only made no sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time the first home machine with a true multi takings os shame the marketing was so bad ! ! ! apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition i also put apple newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason i only wish that vulcan inc flipstart was just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvsthe swiss army knife by far the most useful gadget i got mine years ago still wearing and using it a lot ! it stood the test of time psion organiser series should be up there had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable case design was good batteries in the hinge a first i think great product innovation the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of err mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that the motorola startac should be number one why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices the psion series ! the first most practical way to carry all your info around i too would back the sinclair spectrum without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now i have put the mobile phone high up the list probably a nokia model sinclair spectrum it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that what i do for a living now i wish more modern notebooks even apple newest offerings were more like the pb particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses they invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use congratulations to apple a deserved win !
tech	sun offers processing by the hoursun microsystems has launched a pay as you go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour sun grid costs users for an hour worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun so called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed said sun chief operating officer jonathan schwartz why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour he asked in a webcast launching sun quarterly network computing event in california the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil gas and financial services industries some of them want to book computing capacity of more than processors each sun said mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment hundreds of servers were used simultaneously working on the problem for a few seconds each although it only took a few seconds the experiment cost because it had used up hours worth of computing power the sun grid relies on solaris the operating system owned by sun initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm which argues that its capacity on demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun
tech	kenyan school turns to handheldsat the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up to date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e slates the e slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver the data is transmitted alongside audio signals the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e slates it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it it also stores this on its hard disc the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project it very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it also a one way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux based system the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions users can scroll through these sections independently of each other eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world largest university libraries all books in the public domain something like million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the e slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the e slates says the project ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting as they need it most

tech	savvy searchers fail to spot adsinternet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits the report by the us pew research center reveals that of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid for results and organic ones the report reveals that of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online almost of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about minutes per month carrying out separate searches and looks at webpages for each hunt a significant chunk of net users carry out a search at least weekly and of those asked only look every few weeks for of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it according to pew research of searchers use just a single search engine use two or three and a small number consult more than three sites tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes a small number said they would really miss search engines if they did not exist the remaining said they could not live without search sites more than two thirds of those questioned said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web of those asked were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search only of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not said the pew report this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference

tech	new consoles promise big problemsmaking games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told sony microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e games expo in los angeles in may these so called next generation machines will be faster than current consoles and capable of displaying much higher quality visuals for gamers this should make for better more immersive games in a pre recorded video slot during microsoft keynote address at the game developers conference held last week in san francisco famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film believed to be battle angel alita the game visual quality would be like a lucid dream said mr cameron but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop the first new console microsoft xbox is not expected to reach the shops until the end of games typically take at least months to create however so developers are grappling with the hardware today according to robert walsh head of brisbane based game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between to make with teams averaging staff in size taking two years to complete a title such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio said mr walsh if you a start up i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for however good you are he said mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright the creator of the best selling the sims games the founder of california maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game spore spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures starting with an amoeba sized organism the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs jaws and other body parts evolve eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities trading and fighting and even building space ships advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game i do want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss explained mr wright few games have hinted at the scope of spore but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers instead of employing lots of artists to create models of the digital creatures spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers the thing i am coming away with from the conference is that next generation content is going to be really expensive and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market said mr wright i like to offer an alternative to that new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference oxford based natural motion launched endorphin v which enables artists to direct a virtual actor the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs for instance or crumples up after a gunshot artists can blend together these visual sequences and include the results in their games the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand and so lessens the need for larger art teams another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester start up genemation its latest tool gencrowd enables artists to create unique photo realistic human faces for games involving lots of people gencrowd works by blending together elements of an in built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities the software can create up to new heads an hour one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices the game developers conference included a special two day summit dedicated to creating mobile games a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago gdc mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates mobile games are a fast growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound and are thus more suitable for playing games

tech	be careful how you codea new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson if it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them if the new law was about border controls defence or even the new constitution then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs a topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions and the way it amends article of the european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re enter them unless amazon lets you because they hold the patent on one click online purchase it is a small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long the new proposals go back to although argument about patentability of software and computer implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made endorsed by the council of ministers radically modified by the european parliament and then re presented in their original form some national governments seem to be aware of the problems poland has rejected the proposal and germany main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an a item and can only be approved or rejected no discussion or amendment is allowed so why should we be worried first there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried if coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrowmore directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else patent this is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright patents are not copyright but something much stronger a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately i have never to my shame managed to read lord byron childe harold pilgrimage if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence the same does not hold for a patent if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files then i am in trouble under patent law at least in the us coincidence is no defence the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents they have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or cross license with other patent holders even this system breaks down of course as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer and other browsers infringed an eolas patent that one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars but small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements the damage to software will not happen overnight of course if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas and it will damage europe computer industry we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
tech	us cyber security chief resignsthe man making sure us computer networks are safe and secure has resigned after only a year in his post amit yoran was director of the national cyber security division within the us department of homeland security created following the attacks the division was tasked with improving us defences against malicious hackers viruses and other net based threats reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation mr yoran took up his post in september and his first task was to get the cyber security division up and running the organisation had a staff of about people and a budget of about the division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make us networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace in the last months mr yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur the warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks the cyber security division also audited us government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network the next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers mr yoran division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals despite this success mr yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week reportedly only giving one day notice to bosses at the department of homeland security amit yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year and we appreciate his efforts in starting the department cybersecurity program said a department of homeland security spokeswoman some reports have suggested that mr yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net based threats in the wider homeland organisation an attempt by us politicians to pass a law to promote mr yoran and raise the profile of his department work is now mired in congress
tech	losing yourself in online gamingonline role playing games are time consuming but enthralling flights from reality but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriouslywhen video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight and to offer a warning an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair keep track of time wrote travis anderson in texas some of the comments were humorous this game is so good im not going to get it there no way i could limit the hours i spend playing it wrote charles macintyre from england but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg you need to get out more could be the motto of any mmorpg shame they are getting more popular as you know this problem is just going to mushroom wrote stuart stanton davies in huddersfield scare mongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices gaming is like any other pastime it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it is spending too much time in the gym in front of the television or reading poetry unfortunately gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make however stories about gamers spending to hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds the scope of these games like warcraft everquest ultima among others is epic and exploration and adventure is almost infinite part of the problem is grinding by which gamers have to perform long winded mindless tasks to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure such open endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing not for no reason is everquest eq nicknamed evercrack e hayot writing in the culture blogzine print culture said recently i used to play the online role playing game everquest a lot by a lot i mean probably to hours a week on average and on weeks where i did have to work as many as or hours he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour was that unusual lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much you lie you do go into work because you had stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watching tv a good thing presumably he wrote explaining how everquest took over his time he quit the game he says because he realised life was more fun than everquest let us be clear such obsession is rare but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far almost people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month only a fraction will descend into obsessives the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind jane who runs the website compiles a chronicle of heart rending stories i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than ome people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality she said one unnamed correspondent all are anonymous wrote on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me i ca talk to him while he is playing there is absolutely no point as he does hear me or is so distracted that i get a ummm ya a few minutes after i ask him a question gaming widows has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers but for some it is not in the least funny another correspondent wrote i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness and some of them are even sadder today our son was five days old the sad truth is my husband spent hours today playing his warcraft game he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream and games ever more immersive there will be no hiding place for social problems i wish hours a week was unusual but i think it probably is an hour stretch is that surprising i known people to play hours at a stretch i know of people who are spending their week holiday from work playing warcraft i know of people who would play ever crack in shifts waking at to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they needed to appear i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life by all standards many of us are addicts so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing or do we just need to make real life a bit more interestingsadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join them i have been in a long term relationship for over years since that began games have become more and more complex and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct i play games a lot definately over hours a week but i do go missing work or other commitments in order to play games i have about a year ago deleted every game on my computer rpgs are the worst the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword unlike books or perhaps even tv you gain absolutely nothing when you stop playing you at the same point as when you started all the achievements of your hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and since you gained nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one despite having little monetary value the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in realitymy advice to gaming widows is if you ca beat em join em that is try playing it yourself if he wants to play as well well at least you be together somewhere i was an addict and it cost me my relationship i still play now but without the guilt hehe how long have i played in one sitting from morning till the early hours of the next day the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drink now thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate obsessive behaviour is of course always cause for concern but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of reality obviously somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem this problem however has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be real any more than for example an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human if mmorpgs have a unique danger in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world but rather that they can be easily accessed the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming but with the nature of modern hour culture the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them there always another quest to do a few of my friends have only had about hours sleep since it was released friday championship manager consumed my life for years one particular session started at about on a sunday paused for a brief sleep at on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another hour session the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore gaming seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did others were less fortunate and dropped out of college now that i am holding a job i avoid online rpgs like the plague when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from till pm when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well hence justifying playing it all evening i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so im trying not to spend so much time on there it not easy i feel as if i got a real addiction going on here for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal once it is completed that is it i am finished time to move on i become obsessed to complete the goal so from that standpoint it is an addiction in a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like falling into a black pit it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real world pretty scary implications if you think about it i ca buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage i just know it ! ! i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress becomes exponentially slower requiring more and more time to reach the next level im sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor slowly building up my character stopping only for food and toilet breaks thankfully i made a clean break and actually managed to sell my jedi account for which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum seven years ago i began playing ultima online this game dominated years of my life they were wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year building up my stats completing evermore quests and battling ogres but somehow i found time to get out even met someone and got married ! has my life changed hell no ! i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning on with the fun ! online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families relationships and good careers a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs the message to the government is clear either legalise drugs or outlaw online gaming ! ! sounds like there are some sad stories here and i can believe them all i play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addictive it is i am resolute that it will not take over my life it certainly gets in the way though i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it i think im obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to im always thinking in the back if my mind that i rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united i am obsessed with online role playing games it not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation goals to achieve etc i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect whereas other games and some other pursuits such as being a couch potato the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature these games are like most things too much of anything is a bad thing but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too they can be great fun living in korea at the moment they have lots pc bangs internet cafes nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games i play xbox live every day i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix the longest i played was a hour straight session i know i play for to long but it an obsession that i ca control can you reccomend a counsellor this is not a wind up but something im increasingly concerned with me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day we both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individual it getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming and enjoying al life i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out the longest period i played was hrs straight i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive but have subsequently just bought the european version could help myself in future im going to regulate my time far more strictly great game ! having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person s health you can expect this not to decline but to get worse these people are pathetic they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and online universe absolutely meaningless when i was a kid at school and i was on half term ultima online was the game ahhhh them was the days ! lol
