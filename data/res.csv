The US firm has shut the majority of its stores globally, but says 80% have now reopened in China. ""We expect the next several weeks to be a challenging period,"" said Nike chief executive John Donahoe, talking about the US and Europe. He hopes Nike can use the lessons learned in China to navigate its Western market shutdowns. ""Consumers are back in the stores,"" Mr Donahoe said of Nike's Chinese outlets. ""They are often wearing facemasks, but they're back in the store"". Nike reported a 5% drop in Chinese sales to $1.5bn in its last financial quarter, which runs to the end of February. It was the first decline in China for the company in almost six years. But it has seen strong online sales, rising by 36% during the quarter. It hopes this trend will help cushion a fall in sales from store closures.  Nike also saw an ""extraordinary rise"" in its personal training apps in China, designed for home workouts. User activity was up 80% as China faced a national lockdown with residents staying at home. The sportswear firm said it would push on with some new product launches originally intended for the Olympics ""when the time is right"". Nike has been promoting its sustainable footwear, made from recyclable materials. On Tuesday the IOC announced it was postponing the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games until next year because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic."
https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-52575313,explainers,Coronavirus: France announces significant lifting of restrictions,1592227208,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p08gyjv0.jpg,"French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a number of coronavirus restrictions are being lifted. Cafes and restaurants are reopening across France and travel to other European countries will be allowed. People will also be able to visit family members in retirement homes, which have been hit particularly hard by the Covid-19 outbreak. Germany, Belgium, Croatia and Switzerland are fully reopening borders with EU countries on Monday. Travellers from the UK will be able to visit these four countries without quarantine or restrictions upon arrival, though they still face mandatory quarantine on return to the UK.  Meanwhile, UK and Spanish travellers to France are being asked to go into two-week voluntary quarantine upon arrival there. More than 29,400 people have died of coronavirus in France, and the country has had almost 194,000 confirmed cases - although the number of new cases has slowed markedly in recent days. President Macron first imposed a strict lockdown on 17 March. These remained in place until 11 May, when the country began to cautiously ease restrictions. In a televised address on  Sunday, Mr Macron said France had won its ""first victory"" but he warned the virus could return. ""As soon as tomorrow, we will be able to turn the page on this first chapter across all our territory,"" he said. Restaurants, hotels and caf�s were allowed to reopen in many parts of France earlier this month - provided distancing rules were observed. Mr Macron confirmed that from Monday, this would also happen in the Paris region, which recorded the highest number of cases in the country. He also said that schools would reopen from 22 June - except for high schools. However, the president added, ""this does not mean that the virus has gone and that we can completely drop our guard. The summer of 2020 will be a summer unlike any other and we will need to watch the evolution of the epidemic to be prepared in case it comes back with renewed strength."" Mr Macron also confirmed that the second round of municipal elections, originally scheduled for March, would go ahead on 28 June. But, he added, mass gatherings would need to remain ""tightly controlled"" because they were ""the main occasions for spreading the virus"". All of mainland France will now be in the ""green zone"" virus alert level while the overseas territories of Mayotte and French Guiana will remain at the ""orange"" alert level. Both territories still have high numbers of cases, which are threatening to overwhelm their hospital systems. President Macron is looking ahead to his last two years in office and the elections which are due in May 2022.  Decisions taken now - in the fall-out from Covid-19 - will determine whether he can win another term. So far polls suggest that, unlike many of his fellow European leaders, he has reaped no real advantage from being the man in charge. Well may he celebrate France's ""first victory"" over the virus, the fact remains that a good two-thirds of the French regard him with irritation, if not frank loathing.  But for want (still) of an obvious rival from the mainstream left or right, Macron calculates there is everything to play for in 2022. And to win, he needs to develop a new identity - both political and personal.   So in politics, after three years of celebrating global liberalism, the buzz-words will now be sovereign and environmental - bringing it back home and making it green. And on the personal, it will be about ""reinventing himself"" (Macron's words yesterday) and cutting out the  Olympian pretension.   Whether France's Joe Publique is interested in buying this presidential re-boot, we shall have to wait to see.  The European Commission encouraged the lifting of all internal border restrictions from Monday but only a small number of nations announced they would reopen.  In Germany, Belgium, Croatia and Switzerland, which is not an EU member but is part of the Schengen free travel area, traffic police and officials enforcing the coronavirus restrictions are no longer present. The Czech Republic is allowing unrestricted travel to and from 26 states but is still banning people from Belgium, Portugal, Sweden and the UK.  Greece has opened its borders and is allowing travellers from farther afield such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea to enter.  Italy already reopened its borders on 3 June as did Poland, which opened to EU travellers on 13 June.  Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S�nchez said the country would allow free travel with EU countries from 21 June, except for Portugal. However, Spain is allowing German tourists to visit its Balearic Islands from Monday as part of a pilot scheme to boost its tourism sector.  Its border with Portugal remains closed until 1 July.  Austria will lift its restrictions on 16 June, but a ban on travellers from Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK remains in place.  Sweden and Luxembourg never closed their borders. "
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52557722,world-europe,Coronavirus: How lockdown is being lifted across Europe,1592317856,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p08g8l7g.jpg,"Across Europe, lockdown measures are being lifted cautiously, in phases.  Businesses are reopening and many children are back in school. Many of Europe's internal borders will be open again from mid-June and there are hopes that external borders will be lifted from 1 July - although different nations are lifting border controls at different rates. Here is how Europeans are emerging from life under lockdown.  Germany began reopening smaller shops in April: in early May control of lifting the lockdown was handed to the 16 federal states. But Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed that an ''emergency brake'' will be applied anywhere that sees a surge in new infections. Foreign minister Heiko Maas announced a travel ban for EU member states and specified European countries including the UK would be lifted on 15 June, provided large-scale lockdowns were not still under way in those nations. Italy imposed a strict and lengthy lockdown on 7 March - initially in the north, then nationwide - with a ban on walking or exercising more than 200m (656ft) from home.   In early May, some restrictions were relaxed and people are now able to travel for longer distances, as well as visit their relatives in small numbers. On 3 June, Italy unilaterally reopened its borders and ended regional travel restrictions, and the country entered phase three of its lockdown lifting on 15 June. Cruises on Italian ships remain suspended.  France's strict lockdown was imposed on 17 March, with residents required to provide a travel permit justifying any outdoor trips.  Restrictions began to ease on 11 May, and on 14 June President Emmanuel Macron declared France had won its ""first victory"" against the virus as he lifted more measures Denmark, one of the first European countries to announce a lockdown, started to ease restrictions in mid-April, with a four-phase plan. The three Baltic states - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - became the first countries in Europe to allow free movement again, but initially only with each other.  From 15 May citizens and residents could move freely across the three countries, provided they had not travelled outside the Baltic states in the past two weeks, were not infected, and not in contact with an infected person.  Those coming from elsewhere still have to self-isolate for 14 days. Estonia then said several countries would not be affected by quarantine from 1 June, including Germany, France and Austria, and the Baltic trio resumed free movement with Poland from mid-June. Restrictions are slowly being lifted in a country that has seen a high number of deaths in care homes. The country unilaterally reopened its borders to all EU and Schengen zone countries on 15 June, as well as to the UK No public sporting or cultural events can take place before 30 June.  The Netherlands imposed a far less strict lockdown than next-door Belgium. Prime Minister Mark Rutte unveiled a five-phase plan for easing lockdown restrictions, which kicked in from 11 May. Austria was one of the first countries to ease its lockdown. The health minister said the reopening of small shops in mid-April didn't cause a spike in cases. Borders have now been re-opened with all its neighbours. Spain outlined a four-stage plan on 4 May to start easing one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, which saw children under 14 confined to their homes for six weeks.  On 1 June Spain moved to a second phase for 70% of Spaniards, but Madrid, Barcelona and some other regions were remaining under tighter phase-one restrictions. The state of emergency is to end on 21 June, restoring freedom of movement and reopening some borders. Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum became Spain's first large museum to reopen its doors, though in all cases 50% capacity is the maximum allowed. Ireland has had a stricter lockdown than the UK, with residents only allowed to exercise within 2km (1.2 miles) of their homes. But a five-stage roadmap - later cut to four - to reopen the country started on 18 May. Switzerland began easing its eight-week lockdown in stages from 27 April.  Yearning for the sound of tourists in the Alps again Portugal has had fewer coronavirus cases and deaths than some other south European nations. The government announced a three-phase plan, reopening different sectors of the economy every 15 days. Greece recorded its first Covid-19 case on 26 February and the government acted swiftly to impose a lockdown. On 28 April, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced a relaxation of lockdown measures in the weeks ahead, with a particular focus on opening up the country for the summer. Fast on coronavirus, now they need to save summer President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia's nationwide lockdown was being eased from 12 May, and that businesses could go back to work to stop unemployment rising further. He also said it was up to individual regions to decide the best policy. But Russia's daily infection rate remains high, compared with the rest of Europe. Is Putin rushing Russia out of lockdown? In Poland, Covid-19 numbers are lower than in many Western European countries. Most of the recent infections have been amongst the country's coal miners in the southern Silesia region. Poland began lifting restrictions on 20 April, when parks and forests were allowed to reopen.  There was no compulsory lockdown in Sweden, unlike the measures seen elsewhere in Europe. But in line with government advice, most people took to voluntary social distancing and working from home. Read more:"

In Paris under lockdown, hotels and restaurants may be deserted but food banks are getting busier. Women with pushchairs, men with umbrellas, everyone a metre apart; there's very little talking.  The government will set out on Thursday how it plans to lift restrictions on movement on Monday. But for many the damage from one of Europe's strictest lockdowns has been done. This centre, one of a network run by the charity Les Restos du Coeur (restaurants of the heart), saw a 40% rise in subscriptions last week. Director Fran�ois Coadour expects the numbers to keep rising and says the profile of his clients is changing. ""We have workers, precarious workers, people who were moonlighting, and part-time workers,"" he told me. ""These are people we didn't see before."" Clients here used to choose their own food from the shelves inside the centre; now they're simply handed a bag of goods through an open door. I meet a young woman waiting in the queue, who introduces herself as Madame Ouattara.   Even behind her mask, her face wears a gentle smile.  She tells me she began coming here last month after the lockdown left her husband out of work. They ate through their savings in weeks. France's biggest economic players have also been badly hit by coronavirus: tourism, construction and manufacturing in particular. The economy shrank by almost 6% in the first part of this year. Philippe Martin, an economist at the prestigious Sciences-Po University and an adviser to President Emmanuel Macron, says the construction industry in France was hit more harshly than in other heavily confined countries such as Italy, and that conditions for restarting work were also tougher here. But he also questions whether financial support packages offered by the government, such as ""partial unemployment benefit"", may have helped to slow the economy too: ""Because this system was quite generous,"" he said, ""it may have pushed some firms to close down, rather than keep trying to produce, because the full wages were paid by the [government]."" Others believe the high losses felt by France are a sign of its efficiency in policing the lockdown. The impact on the future economy here is likely to be severe - the worst recession since World War Two, as the government put it.   It's also expected to hit Italy, Spain and Greece very hard.   Germany and Austria, meanwhile, seem to have escaped relatively lightly, leading some to question whether this crisis could create fatal cracks in the eurozone. Jean-Claude Trichet, who ran the European Central Bank during the last financial crisis, says he's been through this kind of ""stress test"" before: ""I was permanently told, 'You will explode the euro, it will evaporate, the euro area will disappear,'"" he said. ""We did not disappear, as you know, but on top of that, four new countries decided to enter the euro area after [the collapse of] Lehman Brothers. The resilience of this historical project is very, very high, and I am absolutely convinced that will prove true in the future."" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe gave details of the changes on Thursday. The plan is to divide the country into red and green zones, with different rules for different places.  ""From Monday we will progressively unwind the lockdown that started on 17 March... but the country is cut in two, with the virus circulating more quickly in some regions, notably in the Paris region, which is very densely populated,"" the prime minister said. France's borders will remain closed, as will its hotels and restaurants.  France has seen 25,809 deaths in hospitals and care homes, and reported 278 deaths in the past 24 hours on Wednesday. Paris is classified as red, along with three other regions. Of more than 23,000 patients in hospital, almost 10,000 are in the Paris area. Genevi�ve Rossillon runs almost a dozen tourist sites around France and says the country needs a ""psychological boost"" from the government. ""Obviously when you hear what Italy has been saying last week, they have been saying 'we are ready to welcome everybody from this summer',"" she says. ""It's not the message France is sending so far."" France's approach to lifting the lockdown may be localised, detailed and bureaucratic but the message after almost two months of confinement is changing: don't stay at home. A new mantra for the nation's economic health. More stories from France"
https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-52534135,explainers,Lockdown update: All you need to know about new measures,1591809015,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5C4B/production/_112872632_ee1500gettyimages-1224668511.jpg,"Lockdown measures are being eased further after more than two months of restrictions. But how is everyday life changing? In England from Saturday, households containing one person, or one adult and children, can form a ''support bubble'' with one other household. The second household can contain any number of people. People can already meet outside in groups of up to six people from different households. In Scotland, eight people from two different households can now meet up outdoors if they maintain social distancing. It is recommended that eight is the maximum group size and that people do not meet more than one other household per day. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can now meet outdoors.  Groups of up to six people who are not in the same household can meet while socially-distancing outdoors in Northern Ireland, although up to 10 people can now attend outdoor weddings and civil partnerships.  In all four nations, permitted numbers of people includes children, and social distancing - remaining 2m (6ft) apart from others - should be followed unless those people are part of the same household or support bubble.  The rules are different for people who are shielding.  The overall advice remains ""stay at home"" as much as possible. But some non-contact outdoor sport is allowed - although rules vary across the UK. People in England can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside together. This means, for example, that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart and practise good hand hygiene. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis are all allowed in England. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere.  Households can also drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. But they should still not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.  Decisions on easing lockdown in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of each national government.  Wales and Scotland do not want households to travel more than five miles if possible, but 11 Conservative MPs have questioned the Wales decision. The Northern Ireland Executive has confirmed that hotels and tourist accommodation can reopen on 20 July. Most people entering the UK - including British citizens - now have to self-isolate for 14 days. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential journeys, and all passengers are advised to remain 2m (6ft) apart wherever possible. They should also consider wearing gloves and a face covering - which some UK airports and airlines have made compulsory. People who can work from home in England should continue to do so ""for the foreseeable future"". People who must travel to their workplace are encouraged to walk, cycle or drive if possible, to prevent overcrowding on public transport, on which they are likely to face social-distance queuing. Wearing a face covering on public transport will be mandatory in England from 15 June. Read the government advice in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Workplaces should be made safe for staff, with more cleaning, staggered working shifts and, for office workers, no hot-desking.  If you're a cleaner or plumber, and need to enter someone else's home for your job, you are allowed to return to work. No work should be carried out in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of Covid-19 symptoms, unless it's a household emergency.  In homes where someone is clinically vulnerable - for example, where a person is aged over 70 - face-to-face contact should be avoided, and strict hygiene rules followed. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay home and shield - because they have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable - can now spend some time outdoors again.  Those with families can go out once a day with members of their own household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. People who are shielding in Northern Ireland can now go outdoors. In Scotland, ""adjustments"" are anticipated in the coming weeks to the shielding guidelines. House moves and viewings have resumed again in England. Potential buyers and renters are able to visit show homes and view houses on the market to let or buy. Anyone who has already bought a new home can visit it to prepare for moving in. Childminders and nannies in England can return to work - and the government has issued fresh guidance. In Scotland, childminders are also now able to welcome children back into their homes. Read the guidance for childcare providers from the Welsh government here - and from the Northern Ireland Executive here.  Some primary schools in England have reopened for some children - with Wales announcing a return for all ages of pupils at the end of June. Exact rules vary, but head teachers and local councils have been working out how best to minimise risks for pupils, staff and parents. Strict hygiene and social distancing is being enforced - including smaller class sizes, staggered breaks and frequent hand washing. However, the government's plan for all primary school years in England to go back to class for the final four weeks of the summer term is now being dropped. Instead, schools will be given ""flexibility"" over whether or not to admit more pupils. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. From 15 June in England, the government says secondary schools and further education colleges will be able to have face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in addition to their ""continued remote, home learning"".   However, at the Downing Street briefing on Monday 8 June, Health Secretary Matt Hancock conceded that England's secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in September or whether they will be taught partially or completely online. All non-essential retailers - from department stores to small independent shops - can reopen in England from 15 June, if they put in place social distancing measures. And outdoor markets and car showrooms can now reopen if they are ""Covid-secure"". Garden centres are now back open across the UK. DIY chains - some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown - have also reopened many of their shops.  Zoos, safari parks, drive-in cinemas and other outdoor attractions are expected to be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June - as long as they follow social distancing rules. Places of worship will also be allowed to reopen for private prayer shortly although not for services or events. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will open from 4 July at the earliest in England, as long as they can meet social distancing measures.  However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later"", depending on when the rate of infection goes down.

The government promised the sites would be thriving communities - with jobs, shops and recreational facilities. But research has suggested the garden villages may be little better than the reviled edge-of town estates they were supposed to supersede. The government said the report was unfair because the settlements were still in their early stages. But the researchers said they believed the 20 garden communities they assessed - still in various stages of the planning process - would create up to 200,000 households dependent on driving. The report has come from Transport for New Homes, a group promoting alternatives to the car.  It has been supported by the RAC Foundation, which said most drivers did not want to need a car to visit the corner shop.  The garden village concept was devised to overcome problems of local resistance to housing estates bolted on to small towns. The government's prospectus said these should be largely self-sustaining and genuinely mixed-use, with public transport, walking and cycling enabling access to jobs, education and services. But the report found that:   One author, Jenny Raggett, said: �Garden villages were put forward as an alternative to characterless estates � but they may well end up with more tarmac than garden.� She said this was especially regrettable as the coronavirus outbreak had prompted more people to walk and cycle � a move that was being encouraged by the government. Steve Gooding, RAC Foundation director, said: ""The vision is laudable but is at grave risk of being missed. The reality looks set to ingrain car dependence. �Many of us will still wish to own and use our cars� but we don�t want to be forced to get behind the wheel for every trip we make.� The report�s authors singled out Long Marston, a proposed 3,500-home Garden Village in Warwickshire. As a former airfield it was categorised as a �brownfield� site, which would help secure planning approval.  The developers� prospectus said: �Long Marston Airfield will provide opportunities to live, work and socialise, all within 10 minutes of historic Stratford."" The report�s authors agreed the trip to Stratford was indeed 10 minutes � so long as you had a car.  They said there was no evidence the village would create employment, and they believed it would not be big enough to support a full range of facilities. Mike Emett from Cala Homes told BBC News: ""It�s on a brownfield site in the countryside, so by definition it�s not near any town.  �We are having a debate ourselves whether the settlement will be big enough to support higher facilities such as a secondary school�. A government spokesperson said: �Many of these settlements are in their early stages and we are continuing to work with local partners to get the right infrastructure in place.� He said the majority of new garden communities on green field sites would have more than 40% of their area given over to green space accessible to all by foot and cycle.

John Tossell, 74, from Bridgend, was last seen on 17 June 2019 going for a walk up Zante's Mount Skopos.   He was on the third day of his holiday with his partner, Gillian, when he disappeared, prompting a major search involving specialists from Wales.   ""It beggars belief he hasn't been found,"" said his daughter, Katy. On the morning of 17 June, Mr Tossell had gone to visit a monastery on Mount Skopos, near the village of Argassi, but failed to return to his hotel. Described as a ""fit man"", he swam three times a week and walked miles with his dogs.  Local fire and rescue teams searched the mountain and volunteers from the Western Beacons Mountain Rescue team joined the efforts after �7,000 was raised to make the journey, along with family members. ""They just don't think he's on that mountain,"" said Ms Tossell. ""If he's fallen, he would have been found and he hasn't. So it raises questions.  ""Has someone taken him or has someone taken him and hid a body out of sight?  ""You just can't help but think these things because it beggars belief he hasn't been found with the amount of effort that has been put in by the rescue teams.  ""Foul play and third party involvement has to be considered.""  Mr Tossell's disappearance was featured in a TV series which looks to solve cases of missing people in Greece.   But 12 months after his disappearance, the police investigation has drawn a blank and Ms Tossell fears the worse.  ""We are no further along than the day he went missing,"" she said. ""We, as a family, had to go to the restaurants and bars in Argassi to source the CCTV and find the image of him and, if the area was searched sooner, perhaps more clues could have been picked up."" Police in Zante were approached for a response at the time of the disappearance. ""We haven't given up hope of seeing dad alive again but there's a massive part of us that knows he's not coming back,"" said his daughter.  ""That's why we are putting the appeal out today, asking people if they were in Argassi to really think back and think hard if you might have seen my dad.  ""During this lockdown maybe you've got time to go back through your holiday photos and check if you can see him in the background.  ""If anyone wants to come forward anonymously just to give us some information, we just want to find him and, if not alive, at least we can then lay him to rest and have closure."""

Investigators told the BBC they have substantial evidence that Madeleine is dead - but this is not enough to take the suspect to court.  The three-year-old disappeared while on holiday in Portugal in 2007. The suspect, 43, has been named by German media as Christian B.  Hans Christian Wolters, a prosecutor in the northern city of Braunschweig - where detectives are leading the investigation - told the BBC: ""We have evidence against the accused which leads us to believe that he really killed Madeleine but this evidence is not strong enough at the moment to take him to court."" The evidence is ""strong enough to say that the girl is dead and strong enough to accuse a specific individual of murder - that strong,"" he said.  However he added: ""One has to be honest and remain open to the possibility that our investigation could end without a charge, that it ends like the others have.  ""We are optimistic it will be different for us but for that we need more information."" The suspect, a German man, is currently serving a jail term in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, for drug-dealing, having been extradited from Portugal in July 2017. He is believed to have been in the Praia da Luz area in 2007, when Madeleine went missing. She had been there on a family holiday with her parents and siblings. In December 2019, the man was sentenced to seven years for raping a 72-year-old American woman in the same Portuguese resort in 2005. The rape conviction is currently under review in the German courts, according to German n-tv news.  German media say Christian B has also been investigated over the disappearance of a five-year-old German girl, named only as Inga. She went missing from a family party in Saxony-Anhalt on 2 May 2015 and has never been found. Police say the suspect was regularly living in the Algarve in Portugal between 1995 and 2007 and had jobs in the area, including in catering, but also committed burglaries in hotels and dealt drugs. A senior judicial source in Portugal told the BBC the joint investigation into the new suspect began after a tip-off in Germany in 2017.  Investigators were told by a friend of Christian B that the suspect had made a ""disturbing comment"" in a German bar, as they were watching news coverage of the 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance, according to the source.  German prosecutors have previously said they are assuming Madeleine is dead. However, the Metropolitan Police, who are working with their German and Portuguese counterparts, said the case remained a ""missing persons"" investigation in the UK because there is no ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine is alive or not. Madeleine went missing shortly before her fourth birthday from an apartment in Praia da Luz, while her parents, Kate and Gerry, were with friends at a nearby tapas bar. Her disappearance sparked a huge and costly police hunt across much of Europe - the most recent Met Police investigation, which began in 2011, has cost more than �11m."
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-52910472,uk-england,Madeleine McCann: What is known about the German suspect?,1591379693,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4577/production/_112738771_christianb2.jpg,"The man suspected by German police of murdering missing British girl Madeleine McCann is currently in a German jail and has many previous convictions. German media name him as Christian B, 43. Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed for privacy reasons. He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine, three, disappeared while on holiday in Portugal in 2007.  He is serving a jail term in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, for drug-dealing, having been extradited from Portugal in July 2017. But there is also an ongoing case against him for rape. In December 2019, he was sentenced to seven years by a court in Braunschweig for raping a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005.  That took place in Praia da Luz, only one-and-a-half years before Madeleine went missing in the same resort in 2007. He allegedly tied the woman up and gagged her, raped her in her bedroom and forced her to hand over cash. The rape conviction is, however, currently under review in the German courts, German n-tv news reports. There was a legal challenge over extradition technicalities in the case. German police say the suspect lived in Portugal's Algarve holiday area between 1995 and 2007, doing odd jobs, including as a waiter, but also burgling hotel rooms and holiday flats. A senior judicial source in Portugal has told the BBC the joint police investigation into Christian B began after a tip-off in Germany in 2017. The source said German investigators informed their Portuguese counterparts and British officials that they received a tip-off from a friend of Christian B, after the suspect had made a ""disturbing comment"" in a bar in Germany, as they were watching TV news coverage of the 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance. Since that time, the official said Portuguese police have been making house-to-house enquiries speaking to those who knew him between 1996 and 2007. Madeleine went missing shortly before her fourth birthday from an apartment in Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007 while her parents were with friends at a nearby tapas bar. German media say Christian B has also been investigated over the disappearance of a five-year-old German girl - named only as Inga. She went missing from a family party in Saxony-Anhalt on 2 May 2015 and has never been found. According to German official records, Christian B has 17 previous convictions, including for theft, forgery, drug-dealing, firearms offences, rape and sexual abuse of children, public broadcaster WDR says. Born in Bavaria in 1977, he grew up in a children's home. In 1994, WDR reports, a court in W�rzburg gave him a two-year suspended jail sentence for sexually abusing a child. Christian B was 17 at the time. But in 1995 he moved to Portugal with his then girlfriend and began doing odd jobs on the south coast. They moved into a house together on the edge of Praia da Luz. At the time Madeleine disappeared the suspect was, police believe, living in a white VW Westfalia camper van with yellow skirting. Police are seeking any witnesses who remember seeing the van. German prosecutors have described the suspect as ""a sexual predator who has already been convicted of crimes against little girls"" and was ""serving a long sentence"".  Police have released photos of two vehicles - the VW camper van and a Jaguar car - which are believed to be linked to the man, as well as a house in Portugal. The day after Madeleine vanished, the suspect transferred the Jaguar to someone else's name. Christian B received a phone call in Praia da Luz at 19:32, which ended at 20:02. Madeleine is believed to have disappeared between 21:10 and 22:00 that evening. Police have released details of the suspect's phone number (+351 912 730 680) and the number which dialled him (+351 916 510 683), and said any information about these numbers could be ""critical"". Police have also released photographs of houses with which the suspect is believed to have been linked. It remains a ""missing persons"" investigation in the UK because the police do not have ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine is alive or not."

The items belonging to the SS leader, found in the possessions of a judge, are now due to go on display. On 22 May 1945, a trio of odd-looking men were spotted by a patrol near a checkpoint in Bremerv�rde, northern Germany.  It was just a few weeks after World War Two had ended but many Nazis were still at large and there were fears some might try to regroup or escape.   Two of the men, wearing smart long green overcoats, were walking ahead of a third man. The trailing figure, sporting an eye patch, looked broken and dishevelled. The pair in front kept glancing back as if to make sure he was still there.   They were taken to a checkpoint where British soldiers asked to see their papers. They handed over the A4-sized identity document German soldiers were given at the end of the conflict which listed their name, rank, date of birth and other information. The third man's papers said he was a sergeant named Heinrich Hizinger.  He must have hoped that the document and his lowly rank would mean he would pass through checkpoints. He was wrong. On the document was an official stamp and British military intelligence had seen the same stamp and unit details being used by members of the SS who had been trying to flee. And so word had gone out that anyone else with those details was to be detained. Next morning, the three men were taken to a detention camp.  Once there, Hizinger asked to see a senior officer. Although his cover was still intact, he must have feared it would not last long and perhaps hoped he could bargain his way out of the situation. So he took off his eye patch and calmly revealed who he really was.  He was Heinrich Himmler, the man who had been head of the SS and a key architect of the Holocaust.  After Hitler's death in his bunker, this made him one of the most-wanted Nazis still alive and a man responsible for many of the worst crimes of the Third Reich.  The British team began to question him to confirm he was who he said. A few hours later a medical officer, Capt Wells, was told to check Himmler. As he came to look inside his mouth he saw a small blue-tipped object hidden in his cheek.  As Capt Wells tried to pull it out, Himmler struggled with the doctor, pulled his head away and crushed the object between his teeth. It was a cyanide capsule. He was dead within minutes. Himmler had been given away by a fake stamp that his own people had placed in a document. The incriminating papers remained hidden for 75 years, but they can now be seen for the first time after being donated to the Military Intelligence Museum in Shefford, Bedfordshire. And alongside the papers are a slightly more bizarre item - the braces that Himmler was wearing when he was captured.  Souvenir-hunting was common and many of Himmler's personal items were snapped up (one of the sergeants who carried out the original arrest got hold of Himmler's slippers, someone else got his shaving foam and razor blades). In the case of the documents, they were recently donated by the great niece of Lt Col Sidney Noakes.  Noakes, born in 1905, was a lawyer who joined the Intelligence Corps in 1943 but was seconded to MI5. Much of what he did at MI5 remains shrouded in secrecy, but after the war he returned to his career as a lawyer, eventually ending up a County Court Judge. He died in 1993.  So how did he end up with the papers? Documents detailing the arrest say ""a gentle interrogation"" of Himmler by MI5 officers took place before the final medical examination. These officers, by convention, would not have been named, and so it is not certain who they were.  ""The logical assumption is that he was one of the two MI5 interrogators,"" says Bill Steadman, curator of the Military Intelligence Museum. ""I can't think of any other way he could have got them.""  He believes it is possible Noakes was given permission to keep the documents by his superiors once any intelligence value had been extracted. The objects stayed with Noakes and his family until they were recently donated and they will be on display once the museum reopens.  They are more than just a curiosity but also explain how a senior Nazi was caught.  ""Without this damning stamp on the document it is possible that Himmler may have been able to pass through the system unnoticed, and escape as did many other wanted Nazis,"" says Bill Steadman.  ""What appeals to me most about this story is that the Germans themselves made his unmasking an absolute certainty."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-53069650,uk-politics,Rashford seeks more change after food voucher win,1592387116,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p08h4k91.jpg,"Footballer Marcus Rashford says he wants to do more to help those in need after winning a battle to have a free school meal voucher scheme extended. His campaign prompted a government U-turn that will see parents claim vouchers for about 1.3 million children in England during the summer holidays. But he told BBC Breakfast there are ""more steps that need to be taken"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the England star's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". The Manchester United forward said he was ""grateful that the prime minister did change his decision"" and that, in a phone call, Mr Johnson had thanked him ""for using what I've built in a positive manner"". Mr Rashford said the extension of the scheme - launched when schools were closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown - has ""bought an extra six weeks"" to ""figure out what's next"". ""I don't want this to be the end of it because there are more steps that need to be taken and we just need to analyse the response,"" he said in an exclusive interview. ""People are struggling all year around so we still need to learn more about the situation people are in and how we can help them best."" The government says �63m is available to support the most vulnerable families through a new local authority welfare assistance scheme, and its Holiday Activities and Food programme offers activities and free meals in the summer holidays. On Tuesday, Downing Street announced all children eligible for free school meals in term time in England would benefit from a ""Covid summer food fund"". The announcement came despite ministers having defended the decision not to extend the scheme for days beforehand. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the ""involvement of a young, well-liked, articulate and high-profile figure"" like Mr Rashford ""made that defence less sustainable by the hour"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC it was ""totally reasonable"" for the government to listen to arguments and change its mind, as it had done in this case. He congratulated Mr Rashford on his ""impressive"" campaign which he said was conducted with ""such dignity and emotion"". Speaking on Sky News, Mr Hancock accidentally referred to the footballer as Daniel Rashford, which he put down to it being ""too early in the morning"", adding: ""I completely misspoke."" Responding on Twitter, Mr Rashford laughed it off, saying: ""I've been called much worse over the last couple of days."" The voucher scheme in England works out at about �15 a week per recipient, and will cost the public purse around �120m. The Scottish and Welsh governments had already said they would continue supporting families with food vouchers, meal deliveries or bank transfers. First Minister Arlene Foster has said she will propose an equivalent scheme in Northern Ireland be extended over the summer ""if the necessary finances can be secured"". Analysis by Hannah Richardson, education and social affairs reporter Campaigns highlighting the struggle many poorer families have feeding their children during the holidays are nothing new. Every summer, charities produce reports detailing parents going without meals so their children can eat. But the intervention of Mr Rashford made that cause mainstream. When the young footballer says there is more to do, he'll draw fist-pumping and applause from those working on the front line. Firstly the scheme only covers this summer holiday. Secondly only those already on free school meals will be eligible. That means any family who falls into enough hardship to qualify - an income of less than �7,400 before benefits - between now and the end of term, will not receive those precious food parcels. And with three million new claimants for Universal Credit since lockdown began and more redundancies on the horizon, there will be questions as to whether this really is enough. A ""wave of unease amongst Conservative MPs over the handling of this latest U-turn"" is likely to be aired later, when the prime minister meets the executive of the backbench 1922 committee for the first time since the general election in December, says BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt. One MP told him the issue had been ""visible from outer space"", while a cabinet minister criticised Mr Johnson's top aide, Dominic Cummings, and said the issue of meal vouchers ""should have been dealt with a week ago"" when raised during Prime Minister's Questions. It comes amid heightened concern over the effects of the lockdown on livelihoods. On Tuesday, official figures suggested the number of workers on UK payrolls fell more than 600,000 between March and May.  The number claiming work-related benefits - which includes the unemployed - was up 126% to 2.8 million, with analysts suggesting poorer areas were being hit hardest. Charities say research among 3,105 parents suggests half of families receiving universal credit or child tax credit in June had fallen behind with rent or other bills. Seven in 10 of those surveyed for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) and Save the Children said they had cut back on food and other essentials. The pressure on families was highlighted by Mr Rashford in an emotional open letter to MPs posted on Monday. The 22-year-old drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up in Manchester.  In the BBC Breakfast interview, he revealed that his mother called him ""about 10 times"" when his campaign was in the news and he said it was ""nice to see her smiling"" about the result. ""When she was going through [the hardship], if someone had spoken about it then maybe the situation would've been different,"" he said."

children catch up on what they have missed while schools have been closed has been announced by the prime minister the most disadvantaged pupils will have access to tutors through a programme over the year from september primary and secondary schools will be given to spend on one to one or group tuition for any pupils they think need it head teachers welcomed the funds but said more details were needed labour said ministers should convene a taskforce involving trade unions and scientific and health experts to help all pupils return to school safely as soon as possible shadow education secretary rebecca long bailey said the plans lack detail and appear to be a tiny fraction of the support needed and called for a detailed national education plan to get children education and health back on track however boris johnson said the fund would help head teachers provide what pupils need he thanked teachers childcare workers and support staff for their efforts during the pandemic and said he was determined to do everything he could to get all children back in school from september we will bring forward plans on how this will happen as soon as possible he said and during a visit to a school on friday mr johnson suggested there may be change in the rules on social distancing with more guidance due very very shortly adding watch this space it comes as the covid alert level has been downgraded bringing with it a possible relaxation of the rules that have kept many pupils out of school the scottish government said it is also looking at social distancing rules in schools after northern ireland decided to reduce its two metre rule to one metre nicola sturgeon has said she wanted schools to open safely as soon as possible the announcement comes a week after mr johnson said the government was planning a huge amount of catch up for pupils over the summer but the announcement did not include any specific push towards catch up activities running through the summer break except a expectation that usual summer clubs would be running instead there is a strong push for head teachers to target catch up help via tutoring from september however schools minister nick gibb told the bbc there was lee way for heads to set up summer schemes if they so wished but he said if you want children to catch up it ca just be done over the month of august it has to be longer term over the academic year research by the institute for fiscal studies ifs suggests the pot represents about extra for each student that is a rise of about but would leave total spending still below levels in real terms early years providers and colleges for to year olds are not included in the plans bill watkin chief executive of the sixth form colleges association said it would be entirely unjustifiable to exclude sixth form students from the package neil leitch chief executive of the early years alliance said the government decision not to include pre schoolers beggars belief but mr gibb said that older age groups had fared better with remote education than other age groups which is why the government was focused on helping younger pupils schools were shut across the uk on march apart from the children of key workers most children have not been to school since then and will not enter a classroom until after the summer holidays children in nursery reception year and year have begun returning to primary schools in england and some year and pupils returned to secondary schools and colleges this week schools in wales are reopening at the end of june with only a third of pupils in class at any time while in scotland schools are preparing to reopen on august social distancing in schools has been halved to just over in northern ireland where ministers are aiming for a full reopening of schools on august however head teachers have warned that parts of the northern ireland plan are unrealistic and undeliverable plans for the subsidised national tutoring programme have been developed with a group of social mobility organisations and academics led by the charity education endowment fund eef the eef has said that until now access to tutoring has been the preserve of wealthy families but this would no longer be the case as schools would be able to seek subsidised tutoring however individual schools would be expected to pay of the tutoring costs in the first year or from their share of the in extra funding being made available to them as part of this package the tutors themselves will be provided by organisations approved by the national tutoring programme many of them will be students or graduates trained by tutoring groups their modelling suggests between and courses featuring three pupils to one tutor would run for an hour a week over weeks tutoring is the catch up approach supported by the strongest evidence said the eef chief executive prof becky francis she said the programme hoped to reach more than a million pupils calling it a tremendous opportunity to create long lasting change association of school and college leaders general secretary geoff barton welcomed the investment saying it would help support the work schools are already undertaking on pupil catch up but he noted that the investment was expected to be spent on tutoring rather than being left to head teachers to decide as ever we suspect the devil will be in the detail and we await further information he said he was also concerned that there was no investment for sixth forms david hughes chief executive of the association of colleges criticised the decision not to include colleges for to year olds in the plans he said teenage college students deserved as much catch up support as every other age group and it was indefensible to overlook them national association of head teachers general secretary paul whiteman said he was pleased ministers had listened to calls for a longer term response rather than short term fixes this is a considerable

with an offence on the spot instead of in court these are often for driving offences but now also cover anti social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown flatten the curve health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases if a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain however taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the curve is flatter this makes it easier for health systems to cope flu short for influenza a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals in seasonal epidemics furlough supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff it allows employees to remain on the payroll even though they are working herd immunity how the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it immune a person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus covid for example it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time incubation period the period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms intensive care hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill they are run by specially trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment lockdown restrictions on movement or daily life where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus mitigation phase the third part of the uk strategy to deal with the coronavirus which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services this could mean the nhs halting all non critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only nhs the nhs hour phone

suggests the reuters institute digital news report found the use of instagram for news had doubled since the trend is strongest among young people it said nearly a quarter of uk year olds used instagram as a source of news about coronavirus but social media platforms were also among the least trusted sources just of people said they trusted social media as a source of information about the virus a similar percentage said they trusted news that had been shared via chat apps such as facebook messenger and whatsapp national governments and news organisations by contrast were both trusted by about of respondents instagram is now used by more than a third of all people who answered the survey and two thirds of under and use it for news putting it just one point behind twitter instagram become very popular with younger people said nic newman lead author of the report they really respond well to stories that are told simply and well with visual images stand out visual stories in recent months have helped climate change the black lives matter movement and the coronavirus have all seen massive engagement on the platform percentage of people who used the social network in the past week it not that one necessarily replaces the other mr newman said they might use facebook and instagram or might use twitter and instagram instagram is owned by facebook which now reaches of people each week the company dominance in how stories are being told remains incredibly important he added the firm also owns whatsapp the coronavirus pandemic also seems to have offered a temporary reprieve to a downward trend in how much news organisations are trusted only of people said they trusted the news most of the time less than half said they trusted their favoured news source in total countries were surveyed only in six of them did a majority say they could trust most of the news most of the time the case was particularly poor in the uk where only of respondents backed the statement that figure was percentage points lower than the nation response in the report that plummet in confidence was only matched by chile and hong kong which have both seen violent street protests and still rank more highly than the uk on each but things changed substantially once the coronavirus crisis hit a slightly differently worded question in april about the level of trust in information about the coronavirus saw news organisations surge to a trust rating on a par with national governments average of six countries april the report authors speculate the identical levels of trust as a result of news organisations amplifying public health advice but that sudden high has already started to fall trust is a precious commodity for journalists which like all social goods is easily destroyed but not easily created maintaining trust in the era of social media gets harder every day as conspiracy theories go viral accuracy is too often sacrificed at the altar of virality and the very idea of truth is so contested this report shows a curious paradox in relation to trust it is true that trust in what is sometimes disparagingly referred to as mainstream journalism is falling yet the huge audiences for those outlets at the start of the pandemic are nothing if not a verdict on the public appetite for reliable trustworthy news in britain with its regulated broadcasting there is still a lot of it about the deeper question is whether a young audience will consume it reuters show the remarkable growth of instagram as a news source which makes facebook purchase of it look ever more like one of the greatest bargains in history if as the authors predict instagram overtakes twitter next year that might be the moment for journalists to finally realise that the latter though their favoured platform resembles public opinion less and less what we seeing is relatively high levels of trust at the time of the lockdowns in the media and national governments but we have some polling since then which shows that trust in the media fell percentage points between april and may mr newman said while not officially part of the report that recent polling suggests that the moment of national unity may have passed amid all this analysis of trust issues most people what the report calls the silent majority prefer what they consider objective news the authors of the report had not asked this question since since when the use of opinion and open stances on news reporting has grown in nine countries where this was explored all said they preferred news from sources with no point of view the strongest preference was in germany japan the uk and denmark these are all countries with strong and independent public broadcasters the report noted in contrast the us where both politics and the media have become increasingly partisan over the years many more people said they prefer news which shares their point of view bbc news which contributed data to the study remained the most trusted news brand in the uk with trust despite the fact that the bbc has come under a lot of criticism what we find consistently is the bbc remains with most people highly trusted mr newman said it along with broadcasters like itv tends to be the most trusted but obviously we have seen that eroding particularly with a particularly vocal minority on both left and right that in the last few years have trusted the bbc less the decline is particularly marked in those on the political left since the election the left saw their confidence in the news dive to just the report found

media,1590685856,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/socialembed/https://twitter.com/jack/status/1265837138114830336~/news/technology-52832800,us president donald trump is expected to sign an executive order redefining the legal protections given to social media platforms it means platforms such as facebook and twitter could be sued if they are judged to deceptively block posts the draft of the executive order says social networks are engaged in selective censorship mr trump has regularly accused social media platforms of stifling or censoring conservative voices on wednesday mr trump accused twitter of election interference after it added fact check links to two of his tweets big action to follow he tweeted the order sets out to clarify the communications decency act a us law that offers online platforms such as facebook twitter and youtube legal protection in certain situations under section of the law social networks are not generally held responsible for content posted by their users but can engage in good samaritan blocking such as removing content that is obscene harassing or violent and the draft of the executive order points out this legal immunity does not apply if a social network edits content posted by its users it also says deceptive blocking of posts including removing a post for reasons other than those described in a website terms of service should not be offered immunity republican senator marco rubio is among those arguing the platforms take on the role of a publisher when they add fact check labels to specific posts the law still protects social media companies like twitter because they are considered forums not publishers mr rubio said but if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher then they should no longer be shielded from liability and treated as publishers under the law the draft of the executive order also calls for twitter which is repeatedly named in the draft of the executive order declined to comment youtube owned by google has not yet responded in an interview with fox news on wednesday facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg said censoring a social media platform would not be the right reflex for a government concerned about censorship fox said it would play its full interview with mr zuckerberg on thursday one think tank warned the executive order could have unintended consequences in the long run this conservative campaign against social media companies could have a devastating effect on the freedom of speech matthew feeney of the cato institute said and changing the communications decency act to impose political neutrality on social media companies could see the platforms filled with legal content they otherwise like to remove such as pornography violent imagery and racism or they would screen content to a degree that would kill the free flow of information on social media that we used to today he said mr feeney said the draft of the executive order was a mess but could prove politically popular in the run up to a presidential election the long running dispute between mr trump and social media companies flared up again on tuesday when two of his posts were given a fact check label by twitter for the first time he had tweeted without providing evidence there is no way zero that mail in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as unsubstantiated then on wednesday mr trump threatened to strongly regulate social media platforms he tweeted to his more than million followers republicans felt the platforms totally silence conservatives and he would not allow this to happen in an earlier tweet he said twitter was completely stifling free speech twitter chief executive jack dorsey responded to criticism of the platform fact checking policies in a series of posts saying we continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally mr trump wrote a similar post about mail in ballots on facebook on tuesday and no such warnings were applied twitter has tightened its policies in recent years as it faced criticism its hands off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive analysis by christopher giles bbc reality check twitter says it enforces its rules impartially for all users regardless of their background or political affiliation but there is no publicly available list of which accounts have had fact check labels or been suspended twitter told bbc news it had previously added fact check labels to two tweets by chinese government spokesman zhao lijian who had speculated back in march coronavirus may have originated in the us the company said the tweets had contained potentially misleading content about covid and have been labelled to provide additional context to the public but these labels were added retrospectively after twitter had been scrutinised for placing them on president trump posts twitter says common reasons for suspending accounts are abusive tweets and spam not the censoring of political opinions but critics say twitter decision making process is opaque and these criticisms do just come from conservatives human rights groups have previously claimed twitter has censured dissident voices and activists in mr dorsey said its staff were more left leaning but he added we do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint or ideology

able to exercise political power is through unilateral executive orders while legislative efforts take time a swipe of the pen from the white house can often enact broad changes in government policy and practice president donald trump has wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege given his predecessor reliance on executive orders to circumvent congress in the later days of his presidency he has a broad range of areas in which to flex his muscle what are executive orders here a look at some of what mr trump has done so far mr trump signed the order at the environmental protection agency epa undoing a key part of the obama administration efforts to tackle global warming the order reverses the clean power plan which had required states to regulate power plants but had been on hold while being challenged in court before signing the order a white house official told the press that mr trump does believe in human caused climate change but that the order was necessary to ensure american energy independence and jobs environmental groups warn that undoing those regulations will have serious consequences at home and abroad i think it is a climate destruction plan in place of a climate action plan the natural resources defense council david doniger told the bbc adding that they will fight the president in court immediate impact a coalition of states filed a legal challenge against the trump administration decision to roll back climate change regulations the challenge led by new york state argued that the administration has a legal obligation to regulate emissions of the gases believed to cause global climate change mars inc staples and the gap are among us corporations who are also challenging mr trump reversal on climate change policy after an angry weekend in florida in which he accused former president barack obama of wiretapping his phones at trump tower mr trump returned to the white house to sign a revised version of his controversial travel ban the executive order titled protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states was signed out of the view of the white house press corps on march the order new language is intended to skirt the legal pitfalls that caused his first travel ban to be halted by the court system the updated ban immediate impact soon after the order was signed it was once again blocked by a federal judge this time in hawaii trump signs new travel ban directive surrounded by farmers and republican lawmakers mr trump signed an order on february directing the epa and the army corp of engineers to reconsider a rule issued by president obama the regulation known as the waters of the united states rule gave authority to the federal government over small waterways including wetlands headwaters and small ponds the rule required clean water act permits for any developer that wished to alter or damage these relatively small water resources which the president described as puddles in his signing remarks opponents of mr obama rule including industry leaders condemned it as a massive power grab by washington scott pruitt mr trump pick to lead the epa will now begin the task of rewriting the rule and a new draft is not expected for several years immediate impact the epa has been ordered to rewrite or even repeal the rule but first it must be reviewed water protection laws were passed by congress long before mr obama rule was announced so it cannot simply be undone with the stroke of a pen instead the epa must re evaluate how to interpret the clean water act a bill the president signed on february put an end to an obama era regulation that aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste senator mitch mcconnell had called the rule an attack on coal miners the us interior department which reportedly spent years drawing up the regulation before it was issued in december had said it would protect miles of streams and acres of forests an attempt to cut down on the burden of small businesses described as a two out one in approach the order asked government departments that request a new regulation to specify two other regulations they will drop the office of management and budget omb will manage the regulations and is expected to be led by the republican mick mulvaney some categories of regulation will be exempt from the two out one in clause such as those dealing with the military and national security and any other category of regulations exempted by the director immediate impact wait and see trump moves to cut business regulation probably his most controversial action so far taken to keep the country safe from terrorists the president said it included the effect was felt at airports in the us and around the world as people were stopped boarding us bound flights or held when they landed in the us immediate impact enacted pretty much straight away but there are battles ahead federal judges brought a halt to deportations and legal rulings appear to have put an end to the travel ban much to the president displeasure trump border policy who affected on mr trump first day as a presidential candidate in june he made securing the border with mexico a priority he pledged repeatedly at rallies to build the wall along the southern border saying it would be big beautiful and powerful now he has signed a pair of executive orders designed to fulfil that campaign promise one order declares that the us will create a contiguous physical wall or other similarly secure contiguous and impassable physical barrier the second order pledges to hire more immigration officers and to revoke federal grant money from so called sanctuary cities which refuse to deport undocumented immigrants it remains to be seen how mr trump will pay for the wall although he has repeatedly insisted that it will be fully paid for by the mexican government despite their leaders saying otherwise immediate impact the department of homeland security has a small amount of money available about to use immediately but that wo get them very far construction of the wall will cost billions of dollars money that congress will need to approve senator majority leader mitch mcconnell has said the republican led congress will need to come up with more and the funding fight and any construction will come up against issues with harsh terrain private land owners and opposition from both democrats and some republicans the department will also need additional funds from congress to hire more immigration officers but the order will direct the head of the agency to start changing deportation priorities cities targeted by the threat to remove federal grants will likely build legal challenges but without a court injunction the money can be removed the center for biological diversity an environmental group along with arizona democrat raul graijalva have filed a lawsuit against the trump administration they argue the department of homeland security is required to draft a new environmental review of the impacts of the wall and other border enforcement activities as it could damage public lands how exactly will trump build the wall on his second full working day the president signed two orders to advance construction of two controversial pipelines the keystone xl and dakota access mr trump told reporters the terms of both deals would be renegotiated and using american steel was a requirement keystone a mile pipeline running from canada to us refineries in the gulf coast was halted by president barack obama in due to concerns over the message it would send about climate change the second pipeline was halted last year as the army looked at other routes amid huge protests by the standing rock sioux tribe at a north dakota site immediate impact mr trump has granted a permit to transcanada the keystone xl builder to move forward with the controversial pipeline as a result transcanada will drop an arbitration claim for in damages it filed under the north american free trade agreement mr trump made no mention of an american steel requirement construction will not start until the company obtains a permit from nebraska public service commission the dakota access pipeline has since been filled with oil and the company is in the process of preparing to begin moving oil keystone xl pipeline why is it so disputed dakota pipeline what behind the controversy in one of his first actions as president mr trump issued a multi paragraph directive to the department of health and human services and other federal agencies involved in managing the nation healthcare system the order states that agencies must waive defer grant exemptions from or delay any portions of the affordable care act that creates financial burden on states individuals or healthcare providers although the order technically does not authorise any powers the executive agencies do not already have it viewed as a clear signal that the trump administration will be rolling back obama era healthcare regulations wherever possible immediate impact republicans failed to secure an overhaul of the us healthcare system due to a lack of support for the legislation that means mr trump executive order is one of the only remaining efforts to undermine obamacare can obamacare be repealed what called the mexico city policy first implemented in under republican president ronald reagan prevents foreign non governmental organisations that receive any us cash from providing counselling or referrals for abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country even if they do so with other funding the ban derided as a global gag rule by its critics has been the subject of a political tug of war ever since its inception with every democratic president rescinding the measure and every republican bringing it back anti abortion activists expected mr trump to act quickly on this and he did disappoint them immediate impact the policy will come into force as soon as the secretaries of state and heath write an implementation plan and apply to both renewals and new grants the us state department has notified the senate foreign relations committee that us funding for united nations population fund unfpa would be withdrawn arguing that it supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation the agency has denied this pointing to examples of its life saving work in more than countries and territories this policy will be much broader than the last time the rule was in place the guttmacher institute kaiser family foundation and population action international believe the order as written will apply to all global health funding by the us instead of only reproductive health or family planning trump order on abortion policy what does it mean the trans pacific partnership once viewed as the crown jewel of barack obama international trade policy was a regular punching bag for mr trump on the campaign trail although he at times seemed uncertain about what nations were actually involved the deal was never approved by congress so it had yet to go into effect in the us therefore the formal withdrawal is more akin to a decision on the part of the us to end ongoing international negotiations and let the deal wither and die immediate impact takes effect immediately in the meantime some

of us diplomats around the world are set to formally criticise president donald trump immigration restrictions officials tell the bbc a dissent cable has been drafted for senior state department officials the white house said those complaining should get with the programme in the wake of mr trump ban on nationals from seven muslim majority countries ex president barack obama has spoken out against discrimination based on faith or religion in a statement his spokesman kevin lewis said mr obama was also heartened by the level of engagement taking place across the country the draft text of the dissent cable seen by the bbc says that the immigration restrictions will not make the us safer are un american and will send the wrong message to the muslim world such cables are not that unusual but a state department official said that the document had been signed by hundreds of people which was described as unprecedented president trump issued the restrictions on friday his executive order halted the entire us refugee programme for days indefinitely banned syrian refugees and suspended all nationals from iran iraq libya somalia sudan syria and yemen for days white house press secretary sean spicer has again defended the policy changes at a press conference he hit out at the diplomats and foreign service officers drafting the dissent cable again you talk about in a hour period people from other countries flew in through our airports and we talking about people from seven countries that the obama administration identified he told reporters and these career bureaucrats have a problem with it i think they should either get with the programme or they can go news of the complaint from us diplomats comes amid international condemnation of the new policies the white house has defended the restrictions as necessary safety measures the cable seen by the bbc says the knee jerk restrictions will sour relations with the muslim world and alienate countries that help in the fight against terrorism it notes that most terror attacks in the us have been committed by us born or naturalised citizens and compares the new measures to restrictions on japanese americans during world war two the end result of this ban will not be a drop in terror attacks in the united states rather it will be a drop in international goodwill towards americans and a threat towards our economy the cable which may be an earlier draft says the white house has said the new rules do not equate to a ban on muslims entering the us and that the restrictions will be lifted once new security measures are put in place the cable signed by dozens of diplomats is expected to be formally sent later on monday through what is called the dissent channel the associated press reports quoting anonymous us officials the dissent channel was set up in the to allow diplomats in the field to convey concerns to senior state department officials in washington last year more than diplomats used the channel to express concern over us policy in syria to the obama administration the new york times reports mr obama statement is the first he has released since leaving the white house citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble organise and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when american values are at stake it says he had earlier said that he may speak out after leaving office if he felt mr trump was threatening core american values by convention former presidents tend to leave the political fray and avoid commenting on their successors foreign leaders have been hitting out at the ban which has caused chaos at airports in the us and created confusion for thousands of people travelling to the country trump ban sparks middle east anger un human rights chief zeid raad al hussein said the ban was mean spirited and wastes resources needed for proper counter terrorism although the white house says only people have been detained for

rashford says he wants to do more to help those in need after winning a battle to have a free school meal voucher scheme extended his campaign prompted a government u turn that will see parents claim vouchers for about million children in england during the summer holidays but he told bbc breakfast there are more steps that need to be taken prime minister boris johnson praised the england star contribution to the debate around poverty the manchester united forward said he was grateful that the prime minister did change his decision and that in a phone call mr johnson had thanked him for using what i built in a positive manner mr rashford said the extension of the scheme launched when schools were closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown has bought an extra six weeks to figure out what next i do want this to be the end of it because there are more steps that need to be taken and we just need to analyse the response he said in an exclusive interview people are struggling all year around so we still need to learn more about the situation people are in and how we can help them best the government says is available to support the most vulnerable families through a new local

free school meals in term time in england would benefit from a covid summer food fund the announcement came despite ministers having defended the decision not to extend the scheme for days beforehand bbc political editor laura kuenssberg said the involvement of a young well liked articulate and high profile figure like mr rashford made that defence less sustainable by the hour health secretary matt hancock told the bbc it was totally reasonable for the government to listen to arguments and change its mind as it had done in this case he congratulated mr rashford on his impressive campaign which he said was conducted with such dignity and emotion speaking on sky news mr hancock accidentally referred to the footballer as daniel rashford which he put down to it being too early in the morning adding i completely misspoke responding on twitter mr rashford laughed it off saying i been called much worse over the last couple of days the voucher scheme in england works out at about a week per child and extending it over the summer will cost around the scottish and welsh governments had already said they would continue supporting families with food vouchers meal deliveries or bank transfers first minister arlene foster has said she will propose an equivalent scheme in northern ireland be extended over the summer if the necessary finances can be secured following mr rashford campaign jessica ekwunife a single parent of five who uses the vouchers said i just want to thank that man when i heard that the voucher scheme would end i got so anxious its bad enough that we in

detailing parents going without meals so their children can eat but the intervention of mr rashford made that cause mainstream when the young footballer says there is more to do he draw fist pumping and applause from those working on the front line firstly the scheme only covers this summer holiday secondly only those already on free school meals will be eligible that means any family who falls into enough hardship to qualify an income of less than before benefits between now and the end of term will not receive those precious food parcels and with three million new claimants for universal credit since lockdown began and more redundancies on the horizon there will be questions as to whether this really is enough a wave of unease amongst conservative mps over the handling of this latest

relying on free school meals and food banks growing up in manchester in the bbc breakfast interview he revealed that his mother called him about times when his campaign was in the news and he said it

protests across the us the arch of his life crossed crests and troughs there were highs as when he as a teenager in houston played american football for the texas state champion runners up yates high school lions there were lows as when he was arrested for robbery in and served five years in prison but mostly it would seem that floyd who was when he died in minneapolis on may was simply trying to live life as any other american in search of betterment in the face of both personal and societal challenges his death amid a public health crisis and economic calamity that has killed more than americans and left over million unemployed has become the latest totem of the ills that plague the country in a native of houston texas floyd grew up in the neighbourhood at the heart of the city black community the third ward just to the south of the city centre beyonc grew up there as did bayou city blues music scene drake a canadian rapper paid homage to its musical vibrancy and floyd himself is thought to have pit bars as part of the hip hop group in the in houston but poverty racial division and economic inequalities mark its history too as with any american city marred by segregation in the century the third ward floyd left in recent years has seen gang violence and tensions over housing anytime i take somebody who not from there people actually are like man oh my god i never seen poverty like this it looks like a bomb went off what happened ronnie lillard a friend from the neighbourhood tells the bbc people are still living in shot gun shacks that were erected in the the poverty is thorough and being from that area it hard to escape says mr lillard a rapper who performs under the name reconcile floyd was well known in the council estate housing project cuney homes he adds cuney homes is known as the bricks and if you from there they call you a brickboy he was a brickboy growing up a gifted athlete standing at six feet six inches friends who knew floyd as a teenager described him as a gentle giant who shone on the field in two sports basketball as well as american football i was blown away cause at years old he was six foot two jonathan veal a childhood friend and former teammate told local media i had never seen anyone that tall before at john yates high school he wore number in the tight end position for the football team and was later recruited to play basketball at south florida state college in avon park florida where he was a student from to according to cnn he returned to texas for a school year at texas a m university kingsville but did not complete his degree his life then took a different turn with a string of arrests for theft and drug possession culminating in an armed robbery charge in for which he was sentenced to five years in prison he became involved in his local ministry resurrection houston after his release and was intent on making changes in himself and his neighbourhood says mr lillard while he was embracing his own life change he was looking around at his community a video of floyd decrying gun violence believed to be filmed in has circulated on social media in which he implored young people to come home his family told the houston chronicle he moved to minnesota in after being encouraged by friends through a christian work programme christopher harris a friend and former classmate told us media mr floyd was looking to start over fresh a new beginning he was happy with the change he was making he added the former athlete found work as a security guard at a local salvation army charity and then took on jobs as a lorry driver and dance club bouncer at conga latin bistro where he was known as big floyd like many americans however he found himself laid off amid mass business closures resulting from the covid crisis on the day of his arrest he was said to have been attempting to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit bill anger over mr floyd death has spurred protests across the us with some descending into chaos and violence over people have been arrested in nearly two dozen cities and the national guard deployed in states mr lillard who described his friend as a person of peace would have supported people rights to be heard and for change but would not have condoned the looting or the violence he had a heart bent towards forgiveness but he also was a man of the people too he said even before his death he was aware that people were hurting i think this thing has grown into something more than george floyd he added speaking of the protests i

grocery store believing the bill he used to be counterfeit a store employee reported it to police mr floyd had been living in minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native houston texas he had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but like millions of other americans was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic mr floyd was a regular at cup foods he was a friendly face a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble the store owner mike abumayyaleh told nbc but mr abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident in reporting the suspicious bill his teenage employee was just following protocol in a call to made at the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but he floyd does want to do that according to a transcript released by authorities the employee said the man appeared drunk and not in control of himself the transcript says shortly after the call at around two police officers arrived mr floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner after approaching the car one of the officers thomas lane pulled out his gun and ordered mr floyd to show his hands in an account of the incident prosecutors do not explain why mr lane thought it necessary to draw his gun mr lane prosecutors said put his hands on mr floyd and pulled him out of the car then mr floyd actively resisted being handcuffed once handcuffed though mr floyd became compliant while mr lane explained he was being arrested for passing counterfeit currency it was when officers tried to put mr floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued at about mr floyd stiffened up fell to the ground and told the officers he was claustrophobic according to the report mr chauvin arrived at the scene he and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put mr floyd in the police car during this attempt at mr chauvin pulled mr floyd away from the passenger side causing him to fall to the ground the report said he lay there face down still in handcuffs that when witnesses started to film mr floyd who appeared to be in a distressed state these moments captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media would prove to be mr floyd last mr floyd was restrained by officers while mr chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck i ca breathe mr floyd said repeatedly pleading for his mother and begging please please please for eight minutes and seconds mr chauvin kept his knee on mr floyd neck the prosecutors report says about six minutes into that period mr floyd became non responsive in videos of the incident this was when mr floyd fell silent as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse one of the other officers ja kueng did just that checking mr floyd right wrist but could find one yet the other officers did not move at mr chauvin removed his knee from mr floyd neck motionless mr floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the hennepin county medical center in an ambulance he was pronounced dead about an hour later on the night before his death mr floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends christopher harris he had advised mr floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency forgery he said was out of character for mr floyd the way he died was senseless harris said he begged for his life he pleaded for his life when you try so hard to put faith in this system a system

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52714804,world-us-canada,george floyd death the same happened to my son,1592177592,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p08g9pl4.jpg,youa vang lee was at her home in minneapolis when her son showed her the video of george floyd dying under a police officer knee lee a year old laotian immigrant who assembles medical supplies at a factory heard floyd cry out for his mother it triggered a deep and familiar pain fong was probably feeling the same way too she said in hmong her eyes filling with tears he was probably asking for me too in lee year old son fong who was born in a refugee camp in thailand was shot eight times by minneapolis police officer jason andersen the officer remains on the force to this day a fact that the lees were not aware of until told by the bbc the officer was terminated twice but has apparently since been rehired although security footage showed lee was running away at the time andersen claimed the teenager had a gun a grand jury declined to indict him and the police department ruled the shooting justified the family sued in civil court claiming excessive force and brought evidence the gun found beside fong body was planted an all white jury found against them youa had spoken publicly about her son in over a decade not since the family came to the end of their legal road with nothing to show for it but after lee saw floyd death she began asking if anyone knew of marches she could attend i have to be there she said although no one directly discouraged her some members of her community questioned the decision the twin cities as minneapolis and st paul are known are home to the largest urban population of hmong in the us many of whom came to the area as refugees in the and the hmong are an ethnic group from south east asia with their own language mainly drawn from southern china vietnam and laos within that community there has been heated debate about how to respond to the black lives matter and justice for george floyd movements which are demanding systemic change to policing for youa lee however there was no debate she wanted to get involved for one reason when fong died in the first people to show up in support of her family came from the black activist community they were the loudest voices for us recalled shoua lee fong older sister even before we asked for help from other communities they had come to us and offered their help although four officers have been charged with the murder of george floyd on may the viral video of the incident only captures two of them former officer derek chauvin who kneeled on floyd neck for nearly nine minutes and former officer tou thao who kept the crowd back rather than going to floyd aid do do drugs guys thao said at one point to distressed onlookers thao an year veteran of the department has been charged with aiding and abetting second degree murder he is also hmong as soon as boonmee yang a fourth grade public school teacher in st paul saw the video he knew things were going to get complicated in the hmong community oftentimes it always been black victims at the hands of white officers but now that someone else who looked like me was also involved in this it made me really concerned he said as a hmong activist yang said that it has always been easy to publicly express solidarity with the black community he said some suffer what he calls sheltered asian syndrome meaning they rarely interact with others from outside the hmong community and that their knee jerk response was to defend thao actions there is also a history of conflict between the two communities particularly in the early days of resettlement according to hip hop artist and activist tou saiko lee refugee families often wound up in the frogtown neighbourhood of st paul and in east st paul areas that have historically had large african american populations there was conflict between youth fights between new immigrants new refugees and those that are currently living in the neighborhood i was a part of that he recalled there some that still hold that tension unlike the more broadly defined asian american demographic the hmong community has a much shorter history in the us almost half of the laotian hmong fled their country in after the fall of saigon in the vietnam war for years the cia recruited thousands of hmong soldiers to fight a so called secret war against the north vietnamese but after the us pulled out without providing an evacuation plan for their allies those who cooperated with the americans or were perceived to have fled some were killed by the communists thousands wound up in thai refugee camps tens of thousands were resettled in minnesota an overwhelmingly white state with few resources for the new immigrant population without the ability to speak the language many could not find work today the hmong population in the us actually has much in common with the african american population in terms of socioeconomic and other quality of life factors according to figures from the southeast asia resource action center one in four hmong americans lives below the poverty line while of the broader category asian americans have graduated university only of hmong americans have a college degree and while of white families own a home less than half of hmong americans and african americans do the hmong community has also long struggled with interactions with police initially there was no hmong representation among its ranks officers struggled to understand and to serve the new population in an infamous case a police officer shot two sixth grade hmong boys in the back as they ran away from a stolen car the officer was never charged tou saiko said he was often racially profiled by minneapolis police as a teenager at one point spending two nights in jail after an officer found a fishing knife in his trunk he said he was never charged but he remembered getting pulled over many times and asked what gang do you affiliate with i say im a college student he recalled still those common struggles between the black and hmong communities did not prevent old tensions from leaping to the fore in the aftermath of floyd death particularly as looting and property damage hit asian owned businesses in the midway neighbourhood of st paul tou thao is a very common hmong name and many who share it with the indicted officer faced online threats and harassment and as young hmong activists in particular women and members of the lgbtq community attempted to express support of black lives matter they faced condemnation and vitriol from within their own community even threats annie moua a recent high school graduate saw plenty of comments online within her asian american political groups that she calls anti black saying things like all lives matter and asking they never helped us during our protest why do we need to help them during that week i lost a lot of friends she said it was during the worst of that online fighting that yang got a facebook invite from a friend to join a group called hmong black lives there were only three members at the time i was on it he said he saw that a large black lives matter demonstration was planned at the minnesota state capitol the next day and created an event page for the nascent group by morning there were members of hmong black lives as of this writing there are now over by afternoon the next day a group of about hmong activists had gathered at the capitol carrying signs that read im a thao and i stand with black lives matter and i am hmong and for blm period for year old moua it was her very first protest and after the amount of turmoil she witnessed online she was scared i was very very nervous she said i did not know what was going to go down among the marchers was a small elegant woman in a face mask and a baseball cap fong lee mother youa after fleeing their farm in laos and four years of waiting in a refugee camp in thailand youa and her husband dreamed of giving their children a brighter future in the us america was supposed to be a refuge she never dreamed her middle son would wind up dead at the hands of a police officer i feel like it was a mistake to bring my children here she said in hmong translated by her daughter shoua now my son is gone fong lee was years old when he went for a bike ride on july he was with a group of his friends in the parking lot of cityview elementary a school in north minneapolis when officer jason andersen and a state trooper pulled up in a squad car the boys took off running with andersen following fong a security camera from the school captured the final moments of the chase fong runs from the parking lot around the corner of the school and andersen is seen close behind with his gun pointed at fong though blurry the security footage does not clearly show a gun in fong hands a fact that andersen acknowledged at trial in the final frame fong is seen lying on his back bloodied and unmoving he was hit four times in the back almost as soon as the news broke al flowers a longtime minneapolis activist who has sued the police department multiple times over charges of brutality started showing up to protests at the school at the courthouse the lees always saw him and another activist the late darryl robinson of communities united against police brutality they did ask to show up shoua lee said they just showed up for his part flowers said that after years of fighting for justice in the killings of black men and women he believed that because fong was asian there was a greater possibility that the officer would be convicted we felt like he was treated like we was always treated flowers recalled we thought he going to get justice and then he did so we were shocked mike padden the lee family attorney in the civil case said losing the case even with surveillance camera footage and the strange history of the gun recovered at the scene has always troubled him in the environment for suing cops was way different than it is now he said it bothers me it was probably the most disappointing case in my career an old russian made baikal caliber semi automatic handgun was found about three feet from fong left hand free of fingerprints or blood in a man reported his gun stolen in a burglary he was later told by minneapolis police that his gun had been recovered in a snowbank and it would be in police custody until an investigation had concluded the gun matched the serial number on the baikal caliber found by fong lee body when that was pointed out at trial by padden the police provided an explanation the gun found in the snowbank was not the baikal there had been a mix up with the identification and the paperwork and the baikal had never been in their custody the minneapolis police department did not respond to questions from the bbc about the case andersen was back on the street two days after fong death the minneapolis police chief later awarded him the department medal of valour for his actions that day the minneapolis police department tried to fire andersen twice after that once after he was arrested for domestic violence and once after he was indicted by federal investigators for kicking a teenager in the head during an arrest the domestic violence case was dropped due to lack of evidence and a jury acquitted andersen in the assault on the teenager despite the fact that other officers had reported his actions that day as excessive minneapolis powerful police union helped get andersen rehired the union is often cited as the reason why it is so difficult to fire officers with problematic records in the aftermath of george floyd killing the city of minneapolis is trying to take on the union by withdrawing from negotiations andersen is still an employee of the minneapolis police department and serves as the chaplain coordinator social media posts show him handing out donations like car seats bed sets and kitchen supplies to needy families in minneapolis in a brief phone call with the bbc andersen confirmed that he is the same officer from the lee shooting and referred all questions to the department media spokesperson it something that been put in the past and i know that was very very hard for them because they lost their son he said of the lees i care for the family a lot and they went through something traumatic both of us had to live through this so when this gets dug back up it probably it something they never want to hear about again it was tou saiko lee who asked youa if she like to come to the state capitol march with hmong black lives and speak about her son it been almost years and tou was also worried that bringing the case back up might be too traumatic but her answer was instantly yes that day as they walked towards the capitol steps to join the larger black lives matter group youa was in front walking silently as the younger hmong participants chanted around her at some point someone handed her the microphone even though she could do it in english she spoke passionately about supporting george floyd family and the movement that was born in his name she promised to do anything she could for the floyd family we have to join hands with them she told the crowd we come here to beg for justice and righteousness she wept openly bringing many gathered around to tears as well even those who could not understand her without fong lee family it would just be hmong people bickering back and forth said tou saiko many people see their own mother in fong lee mother many hmong people and so to see her in that emotional state with those empowering words calling for solidarity i thought that was a breath of fresh air when told that fong mother had joined the george floyd protests flowers was pleased im proud that she out there supporting he said my memory is watching her have to go through that and not understanding the law not understanding what was really happening in the united states that this could happen we as african americans we knew what was the possibility and we knew that could happen that was sad because we lost another case that was another case we lost and although not everyone in the crowd for the first ever hmong black lives march could understand her according to annie moua the person who took the microphone immediately after youa summed it up perfectly you do need to understand hmong to know what this pain feels like

years she said sources told bbc home affairs correspondent dominic casciani that mr saadallah came to the attention of the security services after they received information he had aspirations to travel abroad potentially for terrorism related reasons however when the information was further investigated no genuine threat or immediate risk was identified our correspondent said it meant that no case file was opened which would have made him a target for further investigation sir mark rowley a former national lead for counter terrorism policing told the bbc that mi has people under investigation but there are who have touched the system at some point he said there were many volatile people who become interested in extremist ideology but the security services faced a problem in identifying which of those would turn into an attacker labour shadow home secretary nick thomas symonds said that with the ministry of justice budget having been cut by over ten years the government needed to re examine the resources available for de radicalisation programmes in prisons as well as monitoring supervision and risk assessment of released prisoners prime minister boris johnson has
